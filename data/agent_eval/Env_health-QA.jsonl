In this study, we determined the concentrations of five BP derivatives, BP-1, BP-2, BP-3, BP-8, and 4OH-BP in urine (n = 101) as well as paired specimens of blood and urine (n = 24 pairs) collected from adults; in matched maternal and fetal cord blood (n = 20 pairs) collected from pregnant women; and in blood collected from children (n = 10). 4OH-BP, BP-1, and BP-3 were found in 61%, 57%, and 25%, respectively, of the urine samples analyzed. 4OH-BP was found in all blood samples; BP-3 was found more frequently in the blood of adults (83%), followed, in decreasing order, by pregnant women (35%) and children (30%). Among all adults, urinary BP-3 concentrations were significantly (p < 0.001) positively correlated with urinary BP-1 concentrations. Nevertheless, no significant correlations were found between urinary concentrations of BP-3 (or BP-1) and 4OH-BP. Our results suggest that human exposure to BP-3 and BP-1 is related, whereas 4OH-BP originates from a discrete source. Females had higher urinary concentrations of BP-3, BP-1 and 4OH-BP than males. The distribution profiles of BP-1 and its parent compound (i.e., BP-3) in urine decreased with increasing age of donors (p < 0.05). The ratio of concentrations of BP-3 between blood and urine was 0.21 in adults, which was significantly lower than that for 4OH-BP (0.36). The concentration ratio of BPs between cord blood and maternal blood was higher for 4OH-BP (0.61) than that for BP-3 (0.48), which suggested greater trans-placental transfer potential of 4OH-BP. This is the first study to document the occurrence of BPs in paired urine and blood, and in matched maternal and fetal cord blood."}

Stop the leak if possible without risk. Use water spray to reduce vapor but avoid putting water directly on the leak. Isolate the area until the gas has dispersed. Containment and disposal as hazardous waste may be necessary. If material enters waterways, notify downstream users. Contact relevant environmental agencies for specific recommendations.\n\nFor initial isolation and protective action distances: \n- Small spills (from a small package or a small leak from a large package): First, isolate in all directions 200 ft, then protect persons downwind 0.1 mile (day), 0.3 mile (night). \n- Large spills (from a large package or many small packages): First, isolate in all directions 500 ft, then protect persons downwind 0.1 mile (day), 2.5 miles (night)."}

{"input": "I would like to know the Disposal Methods of the molecule referred to as CCC(CC)C(=O)OCCOCCOCCOC(=O)C(CC)CC.", "output": "The molecule is a waste sludge, specifically a byproduct of industrial processes such as chemical manufacturing, paper production, and waste recycling. The sludge is composed of various organic and inorganic components, including nutrients, minerals, and contaminants, such as heavy metals, organic acids, and organic compounds.\nThe disposal method for waste sludge is crucial to ensure environmental safety and minimize the risk of pollution. The primary disposal method for waste sludge is land treatment or burial, which involves the following steps:\n\n1. Collection: Waste sludge is collected from various sources, including industrial facilities, landfills, and waste treatment plants. The collection process may involve the use of trucks, excavators, or other equipment to transport the sludge to a designated disposal site.\n2. Pre-treatment: Before disposal, waste sludge is typically pre-treated to remove contaminants, such as organic acids, heavy metals, and organic compounds, that may pose a risk to human health and the environment. This may involve chemical treatment, physical separation, or biological treatment methods.\n3. Treatment: The pre-treatment steps are followed by a series of treatment processes, including chemical treatment, physical separation, or biological treatment, depending on the specific sludge characteristics and the desired disposal outcome. The treatment process may involve the addition of chemicals, such as acids, alkalis, or enzymes, to break down the organic components of the sludge and remove hazardous substances.\n4. Drying: After treatment, the sludge is dried to remove moisture and reduce the volume of the waste. This may involve the use of heat, vacuum, or other drying techniques, depending on the specific conditions and the desired disposal outcome.\n5. Land disposal: The dried waste is then transported to a designated disposal site, such as a sanitary landfill or a waste-to-energy facility. The disposal site is designed to meet environmental standards for land treatment and burial, including the use of appropriate liners, leachate collection systems, and monitoring of environmental conditions.\n6. Monitoring and evaluation: The disposal site is monitored regularly to ensure that the waste is being treated and disposed of safely and efficiently. This may involve the collection of data on the sludge's composition, moisture content, and environmental conditions, as well as the monitoring of any potential health or environmental risks.\n7. Disposal alternatives: In some cases, alternative disposal methods may be considered for waste sludge, such as incineration, composting, or anaerobic digestion. These methods may be more environmentally friendly or cost-effective than land treatment or burial, but they may also have different disposal requirements and limitations.\n8. Regulatory compliance: The disposal of waste sludge is subject to regulatory guidelines and standards, including those related to environmental protection, waste management, and hazardous waste disposal. Compliance with these guidelines is essential to ensure that the waste is disposed of safely and efficiently, minimizing the risk of pollution and environmental damage.\n\nIn summary, the waste sludge is a complex and challenging waste management issue that requires careful consideration of its composition, treatment, and disposal methods. The primary disposal method for waste sludge is land treatment or burial, which involves the collection, pre-treatment, treatment, drying, and disposal of the waste at a designated disposal site. The disposal method is subject to significant revision and may involve alternative disposal methods, regulatory compliance, and ongoing monitoring and evaluation to ensure that the waste is being treated and disposed of safely and efficiently."}

{"input": "Can you share the Ecotoxicity of the molecule known as CC(C)=CCCC(C)CC=O?", "output": "The molecule citronellal is the main component of citronellal oil. Drosophila use two pathways for direct avoidance of citronellal. The olfactory coreceptor OR83b contributes to citronellal repulsion and is essential for citronellal-evoked action potentials. Mutations affecting the Ca(2+)-permeable cation channel TRPA1 result in a comparable defect in avoiding citronellal vapor. The TRPA1-dependent aversion to citronellal relies on a G protein (Gq)/phospholipase C (PLC) signaling cascade rather than direct detection of citronellal by TRPA1. Loss of TRPA1, Gq, or PLC causes an increase in the frequency of citronellal-evoked action potentials in olfactory receptor neurons. Absence of the Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel (BK channel) Slowpoke results in a similar impairment in citronellal avoidance and an increase in the frequency of action potentials."}

A complex adduct pattern was detected in liver and intestine of exposed fish. For the time-course studies fish were exposed either by oral administration or by intraperitoneal injection. Following a single i.p. injection of the mixture significantly elevated DNA adduct levels were detected in the liver after 1 day. Adduct levels were higher in liver than in intestine, in which significant elevation were detected from day 3 to 12. Following exposure via food, adduct levels were detected in both liver and intestine 1 day after exposure, and continued to increase until day 3 in liver and day 6 in intestine. Calculation of a binding index, which compensates for differences in dosage, resulted in much higher adduct formation following oral exposure. Pikes receiving single oral doses exhibited significantly higher adduct levels in both liver and intestine compared to controls. Hepatic adduct levels were also higher in fish given higher doses. Results from this study show that DNA adducts are rapidly formed in juvenile northern pike following both i.p. injection and feeding of a mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. A maximum level was reached within a few days, which then persisted at approximately the same level for at least 9-12 days. The results also show that higher levels of adducts were obtained following oral administration compared to i.p. injection, particularly in the intestine."}

Nine groups of birds of mixed sex received either corn oil or 50, 100, 190, or 350 mg 2,6-DNT/kg body weight/day or 20, 80, 125, or 180 mg RDX/kg body weight/day mixed in corn oil via gavage for 14 days. Etiology of disease was markedly different between compounds. Increased RDX exposure caused an inverse relationship to time of death, symptoms including clonic followed by tonic convulsions, and death shortly thereafter. Brain concentrations of RDX postmortem, however, were relatively consistent (mean +/- standard error, 20.5 +/- 2.9 mg/kg tissue). Observations of 2,6-DNT effects included gastrointestinal distress, dehydration, and a reduction in body mass and feed consumption. Together, these data suggest that RDX is more toxic from short, repeated exposures than 2,6-DNT, resulting in central nervous system-related effects, whereas 2,6-DNT causes gastrointestinal disturbances at higher exposures."}

The study deviated from the standard protocol by having a two-week pre-treatment period followed by a 6-week exposure period instead of the recommended 10-week pre-laying exposure and 10-week egg-laying exposure period. The most sensitive endpoints observed were food consumption and male body weight gain in adults, both showing significant adverse effects at all treatment levels. Consequently, the required NOAEC could not be statistically determined (<158 mg ai/kg diet) from this study. The most sensitive reproductive parameters affected were a significant reduction in hatchlings per eggs set and number of cracked eggs at the highest test concentration. Additionally, there was a 16% reduction in absolute testes weight in the 982 mg/kg group, along with significant egg shell thinning and decreased egg strength at the highest test concentration, indicating potential effects on endocrine-mediated processes."}

The ratios of average IC(50) to LC(50) did not significantly differ with exposure time, suggesting FG cells could be a good bioassay system for rapid LC(50) estimation. Liver and gill were major target organs, with gill damage likely contributing to flounder lethality. Liver showed higher detoxification capacity than gills, as indicated by GST and EROD activities. Fenpyroximate initially increased antioxidant enzyme activities in exposed cells and tissues, but inhibition occurred with continued exposure, suggesting oxidative stress and potential disruption of mitochondrial respiratory chain."}

The World Health Organization has set a provisional guideline limit of 1 ug/L microcystin-LR (MCLR) in freshwater. However, MCLR concentrations in several water bodies have exceeded this level. Despite this recommended human safety standard, MCLR-induced endocrine-disrupting effects and reproductive toxicity on male frog (Rana nigromaculata) were demonstrated in this study. Results showed that sperm motility and sperm count were significantly and negatively correlated with exposure time and concentration. By contrast, abnormal sperm rate was positively correlated with both parameters. Ultrastructural observation results revealed abnormal sperm morphologies, vacuoles in spermatogenic cells, cell dispersion, incomplete cell structures, and deformed nucleoli. These results indicated that MCLR could induce toxic effects on the reproductive system of frogs, significantly decrease testosterone content, and rapidly increase estradiol content. Prolonged exposure and increased concentration enhanced the relative expression levels of P450 aromatase and steroidogenic factor 1; thus, endocrine function in frogs was disrupted. This study is the first to demonstrate in vivo MCLR toxicity in the reproductive system of male R. nigromaculata. This study provided a scientific basis of the global decline in amphibian populations."}

The definitive test consisted of exposing groups of 20 aquatic species to nominal concentrations of the compound, a dilution water control, and a solvent control. Observations for biological response and water quality parameters were made at 24-hour intervals. The organisms were tested for 96 hours under controlled conditions. Dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, conductivity, and salinity were measured in all test chambers at specific time points. Alkalinity was determined for each concentration at the beginning and end of the test. The diluent was aerated prior to the preparation of the test solutions. Organisms were not fed during the test. The LC50 value was determined using probit analysis. All dissolved oxygen values were measured above 60% saturation in all chambers for the first 48 hours. Mortality ratios were recorded for each concentration. At certain concentrations, abnormal behavior and mortality were observed. The results of the 10 mg/L test concentration were considered valid for use in an LC50 determination. In the 50 mg/L concentration, all organisms showed abnormal behavior and died quickly. However, the corresponding solvent control resulted in rapid mortality, invalidating this test concentration."}

The acute toxicity of the compounds to Daphnia magna was studied by determining the concentration causing immobilization of the organism. MX proved to be more toxic than MCA both in the cellular assays and in the acute toxicity test with D. magna. MX was more toxic to hepatocytes than to gill epithelial cells. The uptake of (14C)MX was also much more efficient in hepatocytes than in gill epithelial cells. The uptake of (14C)MX in hepatocytes was not inhibited by taurocholic acid in excess, indicating that MX is not taken up by the carrier complex responsible for the uptake of taurocholate in the hepatocytes. Both the acute toxicity to D. magna and cytotoxicity of MX and MCA was rather low (EC50 values > 0.1 mM) and it was concluded that it is very unlikely that MX and MCA at concentrations occurring in recipients receiving chlorination effluents from pulp mills or chlorinated domestic sewage, as regards their acute toxicity, implies a risk for aquatic animals."}

In the present study, the potential genotoxicity and immunotoxicity of three neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, nitenpyram, and dinotefuran) were assessed in Chinese rare minnows by using a 60-day chronic toxicity test. The hematological and biochemical parameters of juvenile Chinese rare minnows and changes in the transcription of six inflammation-related genes were determined after exposure to neonicotinoids at 0.1, 0.5, or 2.0 mg/L. A clear difference in the frequency of erythrocytes with micronuclei (MN) was observed after treatment with 2.0 mg/L imidacloprid (p<0.05). Additionally, exposure to 0.5 or 2.0 mg/L imidacloprid significantly increased the binucleated (BN) erythrocytes and those with notched nuclei (NT) (p<0.05). A serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) assay showed significant alterations in the serum protein in all treatments (p<0.05), and further analysis indicated decreases in immunoglobulin (Ig) in treatments with 0.5 or 2.0 mg/L imidacloprid or dinotefuran or with 0.1 mg/L nitenpyram (p<0.05). Moreover, a biochemical assay confirmed that immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels were indeed significantly decreased upon treatment with imidacloprid or dinotefuran at 0.5 or 2.0 mg/L (p<0.05). In addition, the transcriptional levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6, INF-alpha, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta were markedly down-regulated after all imidacloprid treatments (p<0.05), whereas the expression levels of only TNF-alpha and IL-1beta were significantly down-regulated following the 0.5 and 2.0 mg/L dinotefuran treatments (p<0.05). Taken together, results clearly demonstrate that imidacloprid, rather than nitenpyram and dinotefuran, can induce genotoxicity. The responsiveness of these immune indicators provides new insight into and evidence of the adverse effects of neonicotinoids on aquatic non-target organisms."}

Expression levels of the genes coding for the ecdysone receptor (EcR), the ultraspiracle (usp, ortholog of the RXR) and the estrogen-related receptor (ERR) were quantified by Real Time PCR after in vivo exposure at different dosages. The EcR gene was significantly upregulated by 4-MBC, OMC/EHMC and OD-PABA, with a dose-related response following 24 hr exposure. The benzophenones, BP-3 and 4-HB, as well as OC did not alter this gene at the same exposure conditions. The transcription profiles of the usp and ERR genes were not significantly affected, except for BP-3 that inhibited the usp gene at the highest concentration. This is the first experimental evidence in invertebrates of a direct effect of UV filters on endocrine-related genes, and is consistent with the known effects on vertebrate hormonal receptor genes. The capability of 4-MBC, OMC/EHMC and OD-PABA to stimulate the expression of the ecdysone receptor, a key transcription factor for the ecdysone-genomic response in arthropods, suggests the possibility of a broad and long-term effect on this hormonal pathway. These findings strengthen the need for further research about the ecotoxicological implications of chronic exposure to these compounds in aquatic invertebrates."}

In Japan, there is an attempt to preserve endangered animals, including the Japanese crested ibis, and there is a question of whether neonicotinoids affect the reproduction of this bird, since they are used in its habitat. Whether the daily oral administration of the neonicotinoid clothianidin (CTD) has any deleterious effects on the reproductive function of mature male only or both young male and female quails as experimental animals was investigated. Vacuolization and the number of germ cells having fragmented DNA in seminiferous tubules, as well as the number and size of vacuoles in hepatocytes, increased dose-dependently. The ovaries showed abnormal histology in the granulosa cells, which produce progesterone. There were significant differences in egg-laying rates and embryo weights between the groups. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPx4) and Manganese Superoxide Dismutase (Mn-SOD), which protect the organism from oxidative damage, showed a dose-dependent decrease. Thus, it is possible neonicotinoids affect the bird's reproductive system through oxidative stress, reflecting an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a biological system's ability to readily detoxify the reactive intermediates or easily repair the resulting damage."}

Assuming that the concentration of hydroxyl radicals in brightly sunlit natural water is 1X10-17 M, the half-life would be about 8.45 years in continuous (24 hr/day) sunlight. Nicotinic acid absorbs UV light at wavelength 263 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis since sunlight consists of wavelengths above 290 nm."}

On the other hand, 99% disappearance occurred in 1 hr on irradiation with light >280 nm. Another investigator obtained a 3-5% degradation in 2 hours on irradiation with intense UV light >290 nm. No data on the photoysis of heptachlor epoxide in aqueous solution could be found in the literature. When a thin film of heptachlor epoxide was placed in sunlight, 45% loss occurred after 250 hr. Heptachlor epoxide is also converted to photoproducts when exposed to sunlight on the surface of plants; 50-60% conversion occurring in 4 hr on rotenone-treated bean leaves to a product that is identical to that formed on UV irradiation of an acetone solution. The rotenone acted as a photosensitizer, as does acetone, and no detectable photoproducts were formed in the absence of rotenone. The photolysis product was a ketone. The form of solid material and the intensity of illumination affects the rate of photolysis. For example, when exposed to July sunshine, 59.3% of powdered heptachlor epoxide decomposed in 557 hr while complete decomposition occurred in 121 hr when dispersed in a solid transparent medium. When a powdered sample of heptachlor epoxide was irradiated on a rooftop from January through mid September, degradation was almost neglible until May, then increased through July, reaching a maximum decomposition rate of 1%/day at the end of July.

Furthermore covalently bonded substituent groups such as the chloro and methyl groups of 4-chloro-2-methylphenol are stable against hydrolysis due to the high negative charge-density of the aromatic nucleus. 4-Chloro-2-methylphenol may undergo direct photolysis due to the absorption of UV light wavelengths above 290 nm. Similar compounds (chlorophenol, dichlorophenol) have been shown to photodegrade in sunlight or UV light (above 290 nm), but the rate at which photolysis may occur in the environment has not been determined(3,6). Chlorinated phenols will undergo photolysis in aqueous solutions as a result of ultraviolet irradiation, and that photodegradation leads to the substitution of hydroxyl groups in place of the chlorine atoms with subsequent polymer formation."}

Butylate degraded slowly on loam soil that was irradiated outdoors in California at approximately 25 °C; an average of 82% of the butylate remained undegraded after 30 days of irradiation. No degradation of butylate occurred in the dark control during the same period. Two minor degradates, butylate sulfoxide and butylate sulfone, were identified in the irradiated soil.

BCFs for tributyltin in oysters ranged from 1000 (water concn 0.15 ug/l) and 5000 (water concn 1.25 ug/l). In studies in which the bioaccumulation and elimination of tributyltin in Red Sea bream (Pagrus major) was by direct uptake from water, from diet, and from both simultaneously, about a quarter of the bioaccumulation was due to dietary uptake. The accumulation factor for dietary uptake was 0.26-0.38 on a dry wt basis. The elimination rate was 0.031-0.037/day and was independent of the source of uptake, water or diet. Bioaccumulation was also independent of the form of tributyltin in the diet. Marine mussels (Mytilus graynus) collected in a lightly contaminated area and transplanted to a highly contaminated area had a BCF of 10,500 for tributyltin; the half-life was 4.68 days. Blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) collected from a highly contaminated area and transplanted to a lightly contaminated area had a BCF of 10,400 for tributyltin; the half-life was 4.82 days.

Acephate, applied at concentrations of 1 or 10 ppm was rapidly degraded from a wide variety of soils (eight soils - 3 clays, loam, loamy sand, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, muck) when incubated at 24 °C at field capacity open to the air (volatiles not trapped and degradates other than methamidophos were not identified). In all cases, half-lives in mineral soils were <3 days at 10 ppm and about 1.5 days at 1 ppm. Half-lives in an Ocoee muck soil (pH 5.3, 68% organic matter) were 6 days at 1 ppm and 13 days at 10 ppm.

A typical soil half-life of 10-66 days has also been reported with less than 10% of applied the molecule remaining in most soils 90-120 days after application. If released into water, the molecule is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 47 and 350 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. An estimated BCF of 408 and a measured 3-day BCF of 235 in fish suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Aqueous degradation studies have shown that the molecule does not degrade via aqueous hydrolysis at pH 5, 7 or 9. In aqueous solutions, the molecule has been shown to photodegrade rapidly when exposed to direct sunlight with a half-life of 10 minutes to a few hours depending on conditions; therefore, photodegradation may be an important removal process in aquatic media. Occupational exposure and general population exposure should be low or non-existent since the molecule is no longer produced or used in the US.

Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur. Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticides in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure.

{"input": "Can you share the Hepatotoxicity of the molecule known as CEAZRRDELHUEMR-UHFFFAOYSA-N?", "output": "The molecule has been associated with mild and asymptomatic elevations in serum alkaline phosphatase levels during intravenous and intramuscular therapy, but rarely affects aminotransferase levels or bilirubin, with changes resolving rapidly once therapy is stopped. Only isolated case reports of acute liver injury with jaundice have been linked to this molecule, most of which are not very convincing. The hepatic injury described in these reports is typically mixed but can evolve into a cholestatic hepatitis. The latency to onset is rapid, occurring within 1 to 3 weeks and is typically associated with skin rash, fever and sometimes eosinophilia. Recovery typically occurs within 1 to 2 months and chronic injury has not been described. This molecule is not listed or mentioned in large case series of drug induced liver disease and acute liver failure; thus, hepatic injury due to this molecule is rare if it occurs at all."}

These elevations, however, are usually transient, not associated with symptoms, and can resolve even with continuation of therapy. Idiosyncratic, clinically apparent liver injury is rare, but several instances have been reported as isolated case reports as well as in case series. The liver injury typically arises after 4 to 16 weeks of therapy and the pattern of serum enzyme elevations is usually hepatocellular with an acute hepatitis-like onset and course. Immunoallergic features are uncommon as is autoantibody formation. While most cases resolve rapidly once the molecule is stopped, there have been several instances of acute liver failure and death or need for emergency liver transplantation associated with its use, particularly if there is a delay in its discontinuation.

Liver involvement is common, but is usually mild and overshadowed by other features of hypersensitivity. In some cases, hepatic involvement is more prominent with marked elevations in serum enzyme levels, jaundice and signs of hepatic failure. The typical pattern of serum enzyme elevations is mixed, but can be hepatocellular or cholestatic. Liver biopsy shows mixed hepatitis-cholestatic injury with prominence of eosinophils and occasionally granulomata. Re-exposure usually results in recurrence and should be avoided."}

In large case series of drug induced liver injury, the molecule has accounted for few instances of symptomatic acute liver injury. Only a few cases of clinically apparent liver disease have been published and the characteristics of the injury have not been well defined, but appear to be similar to the features of hepatic injury associated with other proton pump inhibitors. Clinically apparent liver injury typically arises within the first 4 weeks of treatment with symptoms of jaundice, nausea and fatigue and a hepatocellular or mixed pattern of serum enzyme elevations. Recovery is typically rapid upon withdrawal of the agent. Rash, fever and eosinophilia are rare, as is autoantibody formation. Instances of recurrence on rechallenge have been reported."}
{"input": "For the molecule identified as 5-methyl-6-[(3,4,5-trimethoxyanilino)methyl]quinazoline-2,4-diamine, what is its Hepatotoxicity?", "output": "The molecule, when given without leucovorin protection, is associated with a moderate rate of serum enzyme elevations, serum ALT or AST elevations above 5 times ULN in up to 20% of patients. When given with leucovorin, however, the molecule has fewer side effects although serum enzyme elevations can still occur. In clinical trials in patients with HIV infection and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, ALT elevations above 5 times ULN occurred in 1% to 8% of patients, but were usually no more frequent than with standard therapy using trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole. The elevations were typically transient, without accompanying symptoms or jaundice and resolved or improved despite continuation of therapy. No instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury attributed to the molecule have been reported in the literature. In addition, the molecule has not been linked to sinusoidal obstruction syndrome or to reactivation of hepatitis B. Nevertheless, the molecule probably has hepatotoxic potential, but because it has limited use, is given for short periods of time and is administered with leucovorin, it has not been convincingly linked to cases of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice."}

{"input": "Can you provide the Hepatotoxicity for the substance named FC(F)OC(F)C(F)(F)F?", "output": "The molecule often shows minor transient elevations in serum aminotransferase levels in the 1 to 2 weeks after major surgery and use of halogenated anesthetics. Appearance of ALT levels above 10 times the upper limit of normal, however, is distinctly unusual and points to significant hepatotoxicity. Clinically apparent, severe hepatic injury is very rare, with only isolated case reports having been published and not all of which were very convincing. The injury is marked by acute elevations in serum aminotransferase levels (5- to 50-fold) and appearance of jaundice within 2 to 21 days of surgery. There are usually minimal increases in alkaline phosphatase and gammaglutamyl transpeptidase levels. Jaundice is usually preceded by a day or two of fever and may be accompanied by rash and eosinophilia. The acute liver injury may be self-limited and resolve within 4 to 8 weeks, but can be severe and associated with acute liver failure. A strong risk factor is previous exposure to any of the halogenated anesthetics and particularly a history of halothane hepatitis or unexplained fever and rash after anesthesia with one of these agents. The differential diagnosis of acute liver injury after surgery and anesthesia is often challenging, and a clinical picture similar to induced hepatitis can be caused by shock or ischemia, sepsis, acetaminophen overdose, acute viral or herpes hepatitis, as well as other idiosyncratic forms of drug induced liver injury."}

Because this compound affects B cell function, it may also be capable of inducing reactivation of hepatitis B, although in published trials of the agent, reactivation was not reported."}

Elevations of liver enzymes above 5 times the upper limit of normal occur in only 1% to 3% of patients. Since approval and wide spread clinical use, there have been no case reports of clinically apparent liver injury attributed to its use. Like sirolimus, it is immunosuppressive, and reactivation of hepatitis B is considered a possible complication of therapy. Yet despite more than 10 years of clinical use, there have been no reports of reactivation of hepatitis B attributed to its therapy. Thus, acute liver injury with jaundice due to its use is probably quite rare, if it occurs at all. Hypersensitivity reactions to its infusions are not uncommon (for which reason premedication with an antihistamine is recommended) and instances of Stevens Johnson syndrome have been reported."}

The role of the molecule in these abnormalities is unclear, but dose modification for serum enzyme elevations is rarely necessary. The molecule is linked to a severe and distinctive liver injury that typically occurs during the second or third cycle of therapy, likely representing severe acute sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Patients experience sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, hemodynamic instability, rapidly rising levels of serum aminotransferase levels, and prothrombin time, with death occurring within 1 to 10 days. Liver biopsy and necropsy findings show centrolobular necrosis with occlusion of sinusoids and hepatic veins. In some cases, hepatic infarcts are present. Eosinophilic infiltrations are common, and peripheral eosinophilia may also be present. Unlike other alkylating agents, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome caused by the molecule is associated with usual chemotherapy doses, not higher doses used in myeloablation for bone marrow transplantation.

It is not clear how sensitization is induced by the generally low concentrations at which they occur but it might be the result of repeated exposure. To compare the strength of contact sensitization induced by a single exposure to 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (60 ug cm(-2)) or three repeated exposures to a subsensitizing dose (10 ug cm(-2)). Two groups (n = 10) of healthy adult volunteers were randomized to receive either a single patch of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene 60 ug cm(-2) or three once-weekly applications to the same site of 10 ug cm(-2) 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene. Four weeks after the last application, sensitization was quantified by measurement of responses (skinfold thickness) to a graded series of four challenge doses. All the volunteers were sensitized and the strength of the responses was virtually identical between the groups. The same degree of sensitization was induced by three exposures to 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene 10 ug cm(-2) as by one exposure to 60 ug cm(-2) of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene.

Fifteen guinea pigs were divided into three groups: five treated with isoflurane in oxygen, five with oxygen only, and five controls. Each group was exposed to isoflurane and oxygen three times for 30 minutes each, once a day for three consecutive days. The activities of free radical enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase), antioxidant parameters (antioxidant potential, non-enzymatic superoxide radical scavenger activity, and oxidation resistance), and the level of the oxidant parameter malondialdehyde were measured in renal tissues. Blood samples were also collected for serum creatinine and urea analyses. The isoflurane-treated group showed decreased antioxidant potential, non-enzymatic superoxide radical scavenger activity, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities, but increased malondialdehyde levels, oxidation resistance, and glutathione peroxidase activities compared to controls. No significant differences were observed between the control and oxygen groups, except for glutathione peroxidase activity. These findings suggest that isoflurane disrupts the antioxidant defense system, potentially contributing to isoflurane-induced renal toxicity."}

In this study, we focused on psoralen to explore FP-induced hepatotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms. The acute oral median lethal dose of psoralen in ICR mice was determined to be 1,673 mg/kg. C57BL/6 mice were administered psoralen intragastrically at doses of 400 mg/kg or 800 mg/kg, and were sacrificed 24 hr after treatment. Changes in various hepatotoxicity indicators demonstrated that psoralen can cause mild liver injury in mice. Psoralen inhibited the viability of normal human liver L02 cells in vitro by inducing S-phase arrest. In addition, psoralen in both the mouse livers and L02 cells upregulated cyclin E1 and p27 protein levels. The 2/3 partial hepatectomy mouse model was used to further explore the effects of psoralen on the liver regeneration and hepatocellular cycle arrest in vivo. The results showed that the decrease of liver regenerative and self-healing capabilities induced by hepatocellular cycle arrest may play an important role in the hepatotoxicity of psoralen. The further mechanism researches indicated that psoralen-induced hepatotoxicity was associated with inhibition of mTOR signalling pathway and mitochondrial injury; furthermore, MHY, an mTOR activator, partly alleviated the inhibition of mTOR and S-phase cycle arrest induced by psoralen in L02 cells. In conclusion, in this study we showed for the first time, that psoralen significantly induced liver injury in mice; the decrease of liver regenerative and compensatory capabilities induced by hepatocellular cycle arrest may play an important role in the progression of hepatotoxicity associated with the upregulation of cyclin E1 and p27, as well as the inhibition of mTOR signalling and mitochondrial injury. Our findings may contribute to the reduction of hepatotoxicity risk induced by Fructus Psoraleae."}

Tumors exhibit a lower extracellular pH than normal tissues. Paclitaxel release from DMAEMA/HEMA particles can be actively triggered by small, physiological changes in pH (within 0.2-0.6 pH units). Monodispersed nanoparticles were synthesized by forming an O/W emulsion followed by photopolymerization. Particles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, electrophoresis, and cytotoxicity. High release rates and swelling ratios are achieved at low pH, low crosslinking density, and high content of DMAEMA. Paclitaxel release is limited to 9% of the payload at pH 7.4 after a 2-hr incubation at 37 degrees C. After adjusting to pH 6.8, 25% of the payload is released within 2 hr. Cell viability studies indicate that pH-sensitive DMAEMA/HEMA nanoparticles are not cytotoxic and may be used as an efficient, feedback-regulated drug delivery carrier."}

Ten rats had arterial, central venous, and subdural cannulae inserted under halothane anesthesia. The animals were mechanically ventilated to achieve normocarbia (PCO2 = 42 +/- 1 mm Hg, mean +/- standard error). Following instrumentation, halothane was discontinued and alfentanil (125 ug/kg) administered iv during emergence from halothane anesthesia. In the five rats that developed somatic rigidity, intracranial pressure and central venous increased significantly above baseline (delta intracranial pressure 7.5 +/- 1.0 mm Hg, delta central venous 5.9 +/- 1.3 mm Hg). These variables returned to baseline when rigidity was abolished with metocurine. In five rats that did not become rigid, intracranial pressure and central venous pressure did not change following alfentanil. These observations suggest that rigidity should be prevented when alfentanil, and, presumably, other opiates, are used in the anesthetic management of patients with intracranial pressure problems."}

{"input": "I'm interested in knowing the Human Toxicity of YFMFNYKEUDLDTL-UHFFFAOYSA-N. Could you provide that?", "output": "The molecule HFC 134a and HFC 227 are used to replace chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in refrigerant and aerosol applications, including medical use in metered-dose inhalers. Production and consumption of CFCs are being phased out under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The safety and pharmacokinetics of HFC 134a and HFC 227 were assessed in two separate double-blind studies. Each HFC (hydrofluorocarbon) was administered via whole-body exposure as a vapor to eight (four male and four female) healthy volunteers. Volunteers were exposed, once weekly for 1 hr, first to air and then to ascending concentrations of HFC (1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000 parts per million (ppm)), interspersed with a second air exposure and two CFC 12 (dichlorodifluoromethane) exposures (1000 and 4000 ppm). Comparison of either HFC 134a or HFC 227 to CFC 12 or air gave no clinically significant results for any of the measured laboratory parameters. There were no notable adverse events, there was no evidence of effects on the central nervous system, and there were no symptoms of upper respiratory tract irritation. HFC 134a, HFC 227, and CFC 12 blood concentrations increased rapidly and in an exposure-concentration-dependent manner, although not strictly proportionally, and approached steady state. Maximum blood concentrations (C(max)) tended to be higher in males than females; in the HFC 227 study, these were statistically significantly (P < 0. 05) higher in males for each HFC 227 and CFC 12 exposure level. In the HFC 134a study, the gender difference in C(max) was only statistically significant (P < 0.05) for CFC 12 at 4000 ppm and HFC 134a at 8000 ppm. Following the end of exposure, blood concentrations declined rapidly, predominantly biphasically and independent of exposure concentration. For the HFC 134a study, the t(1/2)alpha (alpha elimination half-life) was short for both CFC 12 and HFC 134a (<11 min). The t(1/2)beta (beta elimination half-life) across all exposure concentrations was a mean of 36 and 42 min for CFC 12 and HFC 134a, respectively. Mean residence time (MRT) was an overall mean of 42 and 44 min for CFC 12 and HFC 134a, respectively. In the HFC 227 study, t(1/2)alpha for both CFC 12 and HFC 227, at each exposure level, was short (<9 min) and tended to be lower in males than females. For CFC 12 mean t(1/2)beta ranged from 23 to 43 min and for HFC 227 the mean range was 19-92 min. The values tended to be lower for females than males for HFC 227. For both CFC 12 and HFC 227, MRT was statistically significantly lower (P < 0.05) in males than females and independent of exposure concentration. For CFC 12, MRT was a mean of 37 and 45 min for males and females, respectively, and for HFC 227 MRT was a mean of 36 and 42 min, respectively. Exposure of healthy volunteers to exposure levels up to 8000 ppm HFC 134a, 8000 ppm HFC 227, and 4000 ppm CFC 12 did not result in any adverse effects on pulse, blood pressure, electrocardiogram, or lung function."}

{"input": "For the molecule named (2S)-2,6-diaminohexanoic acid, could you provide its Milk Concentrations?", "output": "The molecule is an indicator of protein quality and nutritional value of milk. Many studies have examined the effects of extraction, treatment and storage of human milk upon its components, though no references are found regarding the possible changes in milk quality as defined by its content in essential amino acids such as lysine. The present study investigates the available lysine content in human milk and the variations in lysine resulting from milk manipulation as follows: (a) Cold storage (refrigeration at 4 °C for 48 hours, and frozen for 15 days at -20 °C); (b) Thermal treatment under conditions of low (Holder)(63 °C/30 minutes) and high pasteurization (75 °C/15 seconds). The results obtained show a decrease in milk lysine concentration after storage in both refrigerated and frozen samples. Pasteurization causes a highly significant loss of available lysine. The lysine losses were greater on applying low pasteurization versus the more gentle conditions of high pasteurization. Conclusions: While manipulation through cold storage or thermal treatment does not affect the protein content of human milk, its protein quality is modified. When human milk must be subjected to hygienization, it is preferable to apply high temperature treatment (75 °C, 15 seconds) than habitual pasteurization (63 °C, 30 minutes)."}

To study the effect of different threonine intakes on plasma and tissue amino acid concentrations, 24 young male Wistar rats were fed three experimental diets based on a mixture of bovine proteins with a whey protein/casein ratio of 60/40 with different threonine contents [group A, 0.86 g of threonine/100 g (n = 8); group B, 1.03 g of threonine/100 g (n = 8); group C, 2.21 g of threonine/100 g (n = 8)]. Eight animals were fed a typical rat diet based on bovine casein as controls. After a feeding period of 15 d, amino acids were measured in plasma and in homogenates of the cerebral cortex, brain stem, liver, and muscle. There was a significant correlation between threonine intake and plasma threonine levels (r = 0.687, p < 0.001). The plasma threonine concentration correlated significantly with the threonine concentration in the cortex (r = 0.821, p < 0.01) and the brain stem (r = 0.882, p < 0.01). There was a positive significant correlation between threonine and glycine concentrations in the cortex (r = 0.673, p < 0.01), and the brain stem (r = 0.575, p < 0.01), whereas the glycine concentration decreased with increasing threonine intakes in the liver and muscle. The presented data indicate that increasing the threonine in plasma leads to increasing brain glycine and thereby affects the neurotransmitter balance in the brain. This may have consequences for brain development during early postnatal life. Therefore, excessive threonine intake during infant feeding should be avoided."}

{"input": "Can you provide the Milk Concentrations for the substance named ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4OC4(Cl)C(Cl)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl?", "output": "The molecule is polychlorinated biphenyls and some organochlorine pesticides. Blood and breast milk samples of 16 women were analyzed during 8 intervals of a 98 day lactation period. A general downward trend in residue levels of blood and breast milk was evident, interrupted by sporadic increases. Most residues in breast milk showed an apparent increase during the 1st 30 days of lactation, which was not statistically significant. During lactation, a statistically significant decrease was observed for the following residues, expressed on a milkfat basis: hexachlorobenzene, oxychlordane, transnonachlor, beta-BHC, p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT. Average milk/blood ratios for polychlorinated biphenyls, hexachlorobenzene, oxychlordane, p,p'-DDE, dieldrin and p,p'-DDT levels were 23, 20, 9, 19, 5 and 30, respectively. Milk/blood ratios for polychlorinated biphenyls and p,p'-DDE levels remained relatively constant during lactation. Residue levels were estimated to increase rapidly during the 1st 3 months of breast feeding, eventually equalling or superseding residue levels in adipose tissue of adult Canadians. No correlation was found between residue levels in milk and blood, whether expressed on a whole or fat basis, but observed p,p'-DDE and polychlorinated biphenyls residue levels in human milk were highly correlated."}

The study characterized infant drug doses and breast-milk-to-plasma area-under-the-curve ratios for olanzapine and determined plasma concentrations and effects of this drug on breast-feeding infants. Seven mother-infant nursing pairs were studied. Olanzapine was measured in plasma and milk with high-performance liquid chromatography over a dose interval (for six patients) or at a single time after dose ingestion (for one patient) at steady state. Infant drug exposure was estimated as the product of an assumed milk production rate and average drug concentration in milk, normalized to body weight, and expressed as a percentage of maternal drug dose, normalized to body weight. The median infant dose of olanzapine ingested through milk was 1.02% of the maternal dose; the median milk-to-plasma area-under-the-curve ratio was 0.38 for the six patients with data collected over the dose interval. Corresponding values in the patient with single-point data were 1.13% and 0.75. Olanzapine was not detected in the plasma of the six infants with an evaluable plasma sample. All of the infants were healthy and experienced no side effects. Breast-fed infants were exposed to a calculated olanzapine dose of approximately 1% - well below the 10% notional level of concern. In infant plasma, olanzapine was below the detection limit; there were no adverse effects on the infants. These data support the use of olanzapine during breast-feeding. However, the authors recommend that breast-fed infants be monitored closely and the decision to breast-feed be made after individual risk-benefit analysis."}

Matched controls consisted of groups of 15 rats and 15 mice of each sex; pooled controls, used for statistical evaluation, consisted of the matched controls combined with 15 untreated male and 15 untreated female animals of each species from a similar bioassay of another test chemical. Except for the matched control male mice, all surviving animals in the study were killed at 104-106 wk. Half of the matched control male mice, which were accidentally killed at week 12, were excluded from the report; the remaining matched control males died by week 94. Mean body weights of the low- and high-dose male and high-dose female rats were lower than those of the corresponding matched controls for the duration of the study. The weights of the low-dose females were similar to those of the matched controls for the first 45 weeks, after which they declined slightly. The weights of the low-dose male mice were similar to those of the matched controls, while those of the high-dose males and of the low- and high-dose females were slightly lower. Survival of both treated and matched-control groups of rats of both sexes was high; survival of treated mice of both sexes and of female matched controls, although lower than that of the rats, was sufficient for meaningful statistical analyses of the incidences of tumors. In rats, a variety of neoplasms were observed in both treated and control animals. Few malignant tumors were found, and no tumors occurred in treated animals in statistically significant incidences when compared with control animals. In mice, a variety of neoplasms were observed in both treated and control animals. These neoplasms are not uncommon in this strain of mouse, and none occurred in treated animals in statistically significant incidences when compared with control animals. It is concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, the molecule was not carcinogenic for either Fischer 344 rats or B6C3F1 mice."}

{"input": "Can you provide the National Toxicology Program Studies for the substance named QWVGKYWNOKOFNN-UHFFFAOYSA-N?", "output": "The molecule was evaluated for reproductive toxicity in CD-1 (Swiss) mice using the Reproductive Assessment by Continuous Breeding Protocol (RACB). Exposure to the molecule at levels ranging from a mean of 66 mg/kg/day in the low-dose group (0.05% in feed) to a mean of 660 mg/kg/day in the high-dose group (0.05% in feed) for 14 wks of cohabitation did not significantly affect measures of reproductive competence, including initial fertility, mean number of litters/pair, live litter size, the proportion of pups born alive, or adjusted live pup weight. A small but significant non-dose-related increase (2-3 days) in cumulative days to litter was observed in the three treated groups. F0 body weight, feed, and water consumption, after 16 weeks of exposure, were not adversely affected by treatment. Treatment had no effect on body or liver, kidney, or testis weight at necropsy, with the exception of a decrease in absolute but not relative kidney weight among females in the high-dose group. No treatment-related testicular histopathology was observed. The molecule at a dose level of 0.5% in feed did not adversely affect preweaning growth or survival in the F1 generation, nor was there an effect of this dose level on feed or water consumption in the F1 generation. Calculated exposure averaged 773 and 1128 mg/kg/day for adult F1 males and females, respectively. No treatment-related clinical signs were noted. The molecule at 0.5% in feed had no effect on the reproductive competence of the F1 generation. There was no effect of treatment on male body weight or liver, epididymis, kidney, prostate, seminal vesicle, or testis weight, sperm parameters, or histopathology. Female terminal body weight was slightly reduced, but there was no effect on organ weight, vaginal cytology, or liver, kidney, or ovarian histopathology. In summary, exposure to the molecule in feed at dose levels as high as 0.5% had no significant adverse effect on reproductive competence in F0 or F1 mice. However, the max tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached, because no evidence of generalized toxicity was noted for the F0 generation at 0.5% of the molecule, and only minimal evidence of generalized toxicity was noted for F1 females at 0.5% of the molecule. Although the MTD was not reached for the F0 generation, data from Task 1 suggested that the animals could not have tolerated higher doses for the length of exposures in Tasks 2 and 3. The 0.2% dose level was the no adverse effects level (NOAEL) for both reproductive and general toxicity in both generations. These data indicate that the molecule is not a reproductive toxicant to either F0 or F1 mice under the conditions of this study (i.e., up to 1230 mg/kg/day)."}

Exposure to the molecule, at levels ranging from a mean of 362 mg/kg/day in the low-dose group (0.25% in feed) to a mean of 1682 mg/kg/day in the high-dose group (1.5% in feed), for 14 wks of cohabitation, did not significantly affect most measures of reproductive competence, including initial fertility, the proportion of pups born alive, or the sex of pups born alive. However, adjusted the pup weight & the number of live pups/litter (both sexes) were decreased by 5 & 20%, respectively, & cumulative days to the fifth litter were increased by almost 3 days in the high-dose group compared to controls. F0 body weight & feed consumption, after 16 wks of exposure, were decreased at the 1.0 & 1.5% dose levels, especially in delivering & lactating dams. At the 1.5% level decreased body weight & increased kidney & liver weights of F0 animals. Toxicity to reproductive organs at the 1.5% dose level was observed in the form of decreased epididymal & seminal vesicle weights by 10 & 21%, respectively, with no change in testis weight, sperm parameters, or testicular & epididymal histopathology. Crossover mating did not clearly reveal the affected sex as the only parameter affected (adjusted live pup weight) was decreased if either sex was dosed at the 1.5% level. Although birth weights of F1 animals were minimally decreased (5.0%) in the high-dose group, the molecule decreased preweaning growth by 26% & postweaning survival by 39% in the F1 generation. Calculated exposure in high-dose F1 animals averaged 2490 mg/kg/day for males & 2939 mg/kg/day for females. Treatment-related clinical signs were reduced size, dehydration, lethargy, & rough coat in the high-dose group. The molecule at 1.5% in feed had no effect on the reproductive competence of the F1 generation. At both the 1.0 & 1.5% dose level, male body & reproductive organ weights (prostate, seminal vesicles, testes) were decreased & relative liver & kidney weights were increased, but there were no effects on sperm parameters or histopathology. Female terminal body weights were reduced at the two highest dose levels, as was ovarian weight in all three dosed groups, while kidney & liver weights were increased in all dosed groups. There was no effect of treatment on estrous cyclicity or ovarian, liver, or kidney histopathology. An MTD for systemic & reproductive toxicity of the molecule for F0 animals was established at the 1.5% dose level, based on decreased body weight at necropsy, increased relative liver weight, & decreased absolute & relative seminal vesicle weight. An MTD of 1.0% for systemic & reproductive toxicity was established for F1 animals, based on decreased body weight, increased relative liver weight, & decreased relative prostate & seminal vesicle weight. In summary, minimal reproductive toxicity was apparent, but only in the presence of significant systemic toxicity."}

{"input": "What is the National Toxicology Program Studies associated with the molecule InChI=1S/FH.Na/h1H;/q;+1/p-1?", "output": "The molecule received sodium fluoride in drinking water at concentrations as high as 800 ppm. In the high-dose groups, male and female rats and male mice died; one female rat was given 400 ppm in the drinking water also died before the end of the studies. No gross lesions were attributed to sodium fluoride administration. Rats received concentrations of sodium fluoride in drinking water as high as 300 ppm, and mice as high as 600 ppm. No rats died during the studies; however, among the mice, high-dose males, high-dose females, and males in the 300 ppm group died before the end of the studies. Weight gains were less than those of controls for rats receiving 300 ppm and mice receiving 200 to 600 ppm. The teeth of rats and mice receiving the higher doses of sodium fluoride were chalky white and chipped or showed unusual wear patterns. Mice and male rats given the higher concentrations had microscopic focal degeneration of the enamel organ. Rats receiving 100 or 300 ppm sodium fluoride had minimal hyperplasia of the gastric mucosa of the stomach, and one high-dose rat of each sex had an ulcer. Acute nephrosis and/or lesions in the liver and myocardium were observed in mice that died early, and minimal alterations in bone growth/remodeling were observed in the long bones of mice receiving sodium fluoride at concentrations of 50 to 600 ppm. The sodium fluoride concentrations selected for the 2-year studies in both rats and mice were 0, 25, 100, and 175 ppm in the drinking water. The teeth of rats and mice has a dose-dependent whitish discoloration, and male rats had an increased incidence of tooth deformities and attrition leading on occasion to malocclusion. The teeth of male and, to a lesser degree, female rats had areas of microscopic dentine dysplasia and degeneration of ameloblasts. Dentine dysplasia occurred in both dosed and control groups of male and female mice; the incidence of this lesion was significantly greater in high-dose than in control male mice. Osteosclerosis of long bones was increased in female rats given drinking water containing 175 ppm sodium fluoride. No other significant nonneoplastic lesions in rats or mice appeared related to sodium fluoride administration. Osteosarcomas of bone were observed in male rats in the 100 ppm group and in male rats in the 175 ppm group. None were seen in the control or 25 ppm dose groups. One other 175 ppm male rat had an extra skeletal osteosarcoma arising in the subcutaneous tissue. Osteosarcomas occur in historical control male rats at an incidence of 0.5%. The historical incidence is not directly comparable with the incidences observed in this study because examination of bone was more comprehensive in the sodium fluoride studies than in previous NTP studies of other chemicals, and the diet used in previous studies was not controlled for fluoride content. In the current study, although the pairwise comparison of the incidence in the 175 ppm group versus that in the controls was not statistically significant, osteosarcomas occurred with a statistically significant dose-response trend, leading to the conclusion that a weak association may exist between the occurrence of these neoplasms and the administration of sodium fluoride. No other neoplastic lesions in rats or mice were considered possibly related to chemical administration. Under the conditions of these 2-year dosed water studies, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of sodium fluoride in male F344/N rats, based on the occurrence of a small number of osteosarcomas in dosed animals. \"Equivocal evidence\" is a category for uncertain findings defined as studies that are interpreted as showing a marginal increase of neoplasms that may be related to chemical administration. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity in female F344/N rats receiving sodium fluoride at concentrations of 25, 100, or 175 ppm in drinking water for 2 years. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of sodium fluoride in male or female mice receiving sodium fluoride at concentrations of 25, 100, or 175 ppm in drinking water for 2 years. Dosed rats had lesions typical of fluorosis of the teeth and female rats receiving drinking water containing 175 ppm sodium fluoride had increased osteosclerosis of long bones."}

Data from a 2 week dose-range-finding study (Task 1) were used to set exposure concentrations for the Task 2 continuous cohabitation study at 0.25, 0.50, and 1.0%. These concentrations produced average estimated daily intakes of nearly 425, 805, and 1,450 mg/kg/day. In the F0 generation, 2 low dose mice died during Task 2, and 1 middle dose group mouse died; these deaths were not attributed to molecule consumption by the study pathologist. Body weights and food consumption were not different across groups during Task 2. During Task 2, the high dose group delivered nearly 20% fewer litters, and those litters contained nearly 6 live pups, compared to 11 pups in control litters. Adjusted live pup weight was reduced by nearly 10%. Additionally, with the exception of the third litter, all treated groups took 1-8 days longer than the controls to deliver each litter. The effect was greatest at the high dose. These reproductive effects prompted the conduct of Task 3 to determine the affected sex, using control and high dose mice. Approximately 70% of pairs mated and delivered live pups in all groups in Task 3. The groups containing a treated partner delivered nearly 34-40% fewer pups per litter compared to controls; adjusted pup weight was not affected. After the delivery of the crossover litter, the F0 control and 1% molecule mice were killed and necropsied. Male body weight was not affected by molecule consumption, though adjusted liver weight was increased by nearly 35%, and seminal vesicle weight was reduced by nearly 30%. Sperm endpoints were unchanged. Female body weight was reduced by nearly 10%, while adjusted liver weight was increased by nearly 14%. The estrous cycle was not evaluated in these animals. No second generation evaluation was performed for the molecule. In summary, consumption of almost 1.5 g/kg/day of the molecule by mice increased liver weight, reduced female body weight, and reduced fertility of both males and females. Lower levels of consumption were without effect on fertility."}

Treatment at 0.18% was significantly more toxic than anticipated. Nineteen of the 20 high-dose females died or were humanely sacrificed & almost all of these deaths occurred at parturition. None of the males died. In the 0.072% group, a 9% decr in the number of live pups/litter was noted; no changes were observed in pup weights, proportion of male pups, or days to deliver each litter. The determination of the affected sex was not conducted, given the small change in litter size. At terminal sacrifice, the avg liver weight & the liver-to-body weight ratio in F0 males exposed to 0.18% were almost twice the control values. In the F1 generation, liver & kidneys were enlarged in both sexes exposed to 0.072%. Sperm abnormalities were greater in the 0.18% group by 40%, compared to controls. Seminal vesicle weight was increased in the high-dose-treated males. The second generation was reared consuming control diet, or diet with 0.072%. At sexual maturity, there was no difference in mating, litter size, pup weight, or dam weight. At F1 necropsy, there was an incr in the absolute & relative weights of liver, kidneys, & testis in the 0.072% group, with similar increases in female liver & kidneys weights. There was no change in F1 female estrual cycle parameters. Under the present experimental conditions, the molecule exerted mild reproductive toxicity in the presence of considerable systemic toxicity. Thus, the molecule is a reproductive toxicant in the presence of significant systemic toxicity."}

Body weights, food & water consumptions, & clinical signs in a dose-range-finding study were used to set doses for the main study of 0.0, 0.5, 1.25, & 2.50% in feed. Measured feed consumption was increased by 8-35% at the highest concn, but was unchanged in other DPP groups. Based on these measures, these concns produced calculated consumption estimates of nearly =0.76, 2.16, & 4.8 g/kg/day. During the continuous breeding phase (Task 2), all control pairs had at least 1 litter, while only 4 of 19 low dose pairs delivered a litter, & no middle dose or high dose pairs delivered a litter. In the 7 litters delivered at the low dose, the number of live pups/litter was reduced from control values by 90%; there were insufficient live pups to calculate pup weights adjusted for body weight. At the end of Task 2, the control & high dose mice were cross-mated. The groups that contained either treated males, or treated females, gave birth to no live young, while 61% of cohabited control pairs bore live young. The F0 control & high dose mice were necropsied after the crossover mating trial. The treated females weighed 9% less than their controls, while body-weight-adjusted liver weight was 56% greater than controls, & adjusted kidney weight was 12% less. Treated males weighed 10% less than controls, while adjusted liver weight was 55% greater. In males, adjusted kidney weights, seminal vesicles, & epididymal weights were reduced by 30%, 29% & 19% respectively. At the high dose, absolute testis weight was decreased by 78%, & there were no detectable epididymal sperm. A second generation evaluation was not performed for DPP.

The purpose of the range-finding study was to determine the doses of the molecule to be used in an immuntoxicology protocol. The range-finding studies were conducted in female B6C3F1 mice. The animals were administered the molecule as a pellet implanted subcutaneously. The pellets were prepared using 1, 3 and 6 mg/pellet as recommended by the producer to obtain the desired blood levels of 100, 300 and 600 ng/ml. These doses proved highly toxic and the pellets were then prepared at 0.01, 0.03 and 0.06 mg/pellet. Two studies were carried out in completing the range-finding protocol. The pellets were implanted on day 1 and the assay evaluations were performed on day 15. Dose levels of 0.01, 0.03 and 0.06 mg/pellet were used; however, the high dose of 0.06 mg/pellet resulted in the death of the mice. The results of the range-finding studies demonstrate that, in the female B6C3F1 mouse, exposure to the molecule, administered by a subcutaneous implanted pellet for a 14-day exposure at doses of 0.06 or greater, produced overt toxicity and death of the animals. Exposure to lower doses of the molecule (0.01 and 0.03 mg/pellet) did not result in significant changes in body weight, change in body weight gain, erythrocyte number, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, reticulocytes or leukocyte number. A slight, but significant decrease was seen in the mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin. Exposure to lower doses of the molecule (0.01 and 0.03 mg/pellet) did not result in significant changes in liver, spleen, thymus or kidney weight when the data were expressed as absolute weight (mg) or as percent body weight. A significant decrease was seen in the lung absolute weight (22.6%) but not in the percent body weight. Exposure to lower doses of the molecule (0.01 and 0.03 mg/pellet) did not produce significant changes in the antibody-forming cell response to the T-dependent antigen, sheep erythrocytes, expressed as IgM AFC/10, while the IgM AFC/spleen did show a significant increase at 0.03 mg/pellet (49.2%). In the surface marker absolute values, no effects were observed in the number of B cells, T cells or CD8+ cells, but a significant decrease in the CD4+ cells (12.3%) was seen. Exposure to lower doses of the molecule (0.01 and 0.03 mg/pellet) did not result in significant changes in the mixed leukocyte response (MLR) or natural killer (NK) cell activity.

Exposure led to a decrease in terminal body weight in F1 generation males and females at the highest dose. A significant increase in relative spleen weight was observed in F1 generation males and females. Hematology data showed slight decreases in white blood cell count, platelet count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit in F1 generation rats. Genistein exposure resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in bone marrow cell number and colony-forming units in F1 generation males, while F1 generation females showed a decrease in cells/femur. An increase in splenic B cells and T cell subsets was observed in F1 generation rats. In the spleen AFC response to sheep erythrocytes, an increase in IgM AFC was seen in F1 generation females. Stimulation with anti-CD3 receptor led to an increase in proliferation in spleen cells from F1 generation rats. Natural killer cell activity increased in F0 generation females at 250 and 1250 PPM doses.

People may be exposed as a result of an accidental release or chemical warfare attack. Additionally, people may be exposed to residues that had been disposed of in bulk quantities years or even decades ago if these disposal sites are violated. The route of exposure would be by inhalation and dermal contact. The volatility is sufficiently high that much of it on the soil surface is lost by evaporation; very high concentrations may result on a hot, still day from this volatilization. Under cold weather conditions, if protective clothing becomes contaminated or if a person's shoes become contaminated by walking on contaminated snow or land and the person subsequently goes indoors, potentially toxic levels of vapors may be released.

{"input": "Would you be able to tell me the Soil AdsorptionMobility of the molecule APQHKWPGGHMYKJ-UHFFFAOYSA-N?", "output": "The molecule tributyltin did not leach from various soils (clay, sand, topsoil, silt) over 16 weeks. Tributyltin strongly binds to sediment with a distribution constant of 2180 at 20 °C. Minimal release of tributyltin or inorganic tin occurred from unshaken sediment in 10 months. Studies indicate that tributyltin does not significantly adsorb to suspended particulate matter and is mainly associated with the dissolved fraction of estuarine water. Addition of humic acids or kaolin clay material does not greatly impact the measured bis(tributyltin) BCF in mussels, suggesting weak binding of bis(tributyltin) species to these materials. Adsorption studies on a variety of sorbents show sorption coefficients ranging from 110 to 350,000 l/kg, with most coefficients around 1,000 l/kg. Adsorption is rapid (hours) and reversible. In a 278-day marine mesocosm experiment, the transport rate from water to sediment was 0.045/day. The distribution coefficient between dissolved state and particulate matter was 60,000 (standard deviation 30,000) between days 2-19. Other researchers found distribution constants for adsorption of tributyltin to particulate matter and sediment ranging from 3400-9300 l/kg and 200-55,000 l/kg, respectively, depending on sediment type and location. The Freundlich parameters for tributyl tin to sediment were log k = 1.07 and 1/n = 0.359. In soil microcosm experiments, small releases of bis(tributyltin) oxide from wood treated with the compound migrated >10 cm from the wood, with 86% of the compound within 5 cm of the wood; no compound was detected below 10 cm or in groundwater at the bottom of the microcosm chamber. These findings suggest that bis(tributyltin) oxide can strongly bind to soil and sediment, but adsorption to suspended particulate and humic matter may be weaker."}

{"input": "Can you provide the Toxicity for the substance named FOCAUTSVDIKZOP-UHFFFAOYSA-N?", "output": "The molecule chloroacetic acid (MCA) is a solid. Most of the chloroacetic acid produced is used to manufacture several hundred thousand tons annually of carboxymethyl cellulose. Another major application is the production of herbicides based on arylhydroxyacetic acids. The anticipated acute and chronic human health hazards posed by MCA are effects on the cardiac system, the central nervous system, and kidneys. In addition, MCA is highly corrosive and irritating to the eyes, skin and respiratory tract. Acute dermal exposure of workers to MCA may result in death even after rapid and extensive washing of the skin area. The effects may be delayed. The biochemical mechanism of action resulting in death is not understood. Contributing factors apparently believed to be involved are: (i) the inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle decreasing cellular energy supply and increasing acidosis with glycolic acid and oxalate production, and; (ii) effects on cellular components where sulfhydryl groups are critical for normal biological activity. Both of these effects may contribute to CNS, cardiovascular, renal and hepatic effects. In addition, the metabolites glycolic acid and oxalate may contribute to CNS and renal toxicity. A case of joint deformity reported after the use of a preparation containing MCA for topical wart treatment. MCA did not induce DNA strand breaks in human CCRF-CEM cells. Fatalities among rabbits are expected when only 3% of the skin is exposed. Thorough washing after 1 minute contact did not decrease mortalities. In rats after subcutaneous administration of MCA (108, 135 or 163 mg/kg) hypoglycemia and lung injury appear to cause death in response to MCA exposure. MCA caused front paw rigidity in 10% of mice surviving a single oral toxic dose (320-380 mg/kg). Male mice orally administered 300 mg/kg bw MCA showed tremors, respiratory depression, and occasionally tonic and clonic convulsions. Some survivors had a Straub tail, severe tremors, and front limb paralysis after 24 hours (after exposure). Pregnant rats were dosed MCA by oral intubation on gestation days 6 to 15 with 0, 17, 35, 70, or 140 mg/kg bw/day. The percentage of soft tissue malformations was increased, however not dose-related. No skeletal malformations were found. In the highest dose-group a statistically significant increase of malformations of the cardiovascular system, comprising predominantly levocardia, was found. MCA was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA98, TA100, TA102, TA104, TA1535, TA1537, and TA1538) and Escherichia coli strains (WP2uvrA and WP2uvrA/pKM101) with or without metabolic activation. A large number of passerine birds, mainly greenfinches, were found dead or dying in a hedgerow close to a field of onions recently sprayed with sodium salt of MCA. Chemical analysis confirmed the exposure of the birds to the chemical. MCA had high regeneration toxicity with teratogenicity in Hydra digestive region."}

{"input": "For the molecule named CC(C)OC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, could you provide its Toxicity?", "output": "The molecule is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. Carbamates form unstable complexes with cholinesterases by carbamoylation of the active sites of the enzymes. This inhibition is reversible. A cholinesterase inhibitor suppresses the action of acetylcholine esterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholine esterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses. Headache, salivation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea are often prominent at higher levels of exposure. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop."}

{"input": "Can you indicate the Toxicity for the molecule HCZHHEIFKROPDY-UHFFFAOYSA-N?", "output": "The molecule kynurenic acid, a uremic toxin, is transported into the kidneys by organic ion transporters, particularly OAT3. Elevated levels of uremic toxins can trigger the generation of reactive oxygen species. This process appears to be influenced by the direct interaction or inhibition of the enzyme NADPH oxidase by uremic toxins, specifically NOX4, which is abundant in the kidneys and heart. Reactive oxygen species can activate various DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) that play a role in the suppression of the protein KLOTHO. KLOTHO is known for its involvement in anti-aging, mineral metabolism, and vitamin D metabolism. Studies have shown that levels of KLOTHO mRNA and protein decrease during acute or chronic kidney diseases due to high levels of reactive oxygen species in the local environment."}
{"input": "Can you share the Toxicity of the molecule known as InChI=1S/C4H11N5/c1-9(2)4(7)8-3(5)6/h1-2H3,(H5,5,6,7,8)?", "output": "The molecule is an antihyperglycemic, not hypoglycemic agent. It does not cause insulin release from the pancreas and does not cause hypoglycemia, even in large doses. The molecule is believed to work by inhibiting hepatic glucose production and increasing the sensitivity of peripheral tissue to insulin. It does not stimulate insulin secretion, which explains the absence of hypoglycemia. The molecule also has beneficial effects on the plasma lipid concentrations and promotes weight loss. Accumulation of the molecule may occur in patients with renal impairment, and such accumulation rarely can result in lactic acidosis, a serious, potentially fatal metabolic disease. Lactic acidosis constitutes a medical emergency requiring immediate hospitalization and treatment; lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations, decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. Lactic acidosis also may occur in association with a variety of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever substantial tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia exist. Approximately 50% of cases of the molecule-associated lactic acidosis have been reported to be fatal. No evidence of mutagenicity or chromosomal damage was observed in in vitro test systems, including human lymphocytes assay. In animal studies, no evidence of carcinogenic potential was seen in a 104-week study in male and female rats receiving the molecule dosages up to and including 900 mg/kg daily or in a 91-week study in male and female mice receiving the molecule at dosages up to and including 1500 mg/kg daily. Cancer preventive effect of the molecule has been studied in mice, rats, and hamsters. In the majority of cases, the molecule treatment leads to inhibition of carcinogenesis. No evidence of impaired fertility was observed in rats following administration of the molecule dosages of 600 mg/kg daily. Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits given the molecule dosages of 600 mg/kg daily have not revealed teratogenicity. No evidence of mutagenicity or chromosomal damage was observed in vivo in a micronucleus test in mice or in in vitro test systems, including microbial (Ames test) and mammalian (mouse lymphoma) assays. Pretreatment of rat cerebellar granule neurons with the molecule greatly enhanced cell viability against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. In aged male mice fed a high-fat diet supplemented with the molecule for 6 months, the molecule decreased body fat composition and attenuated declines in motor function induced by a high-fat diet. Performance in the Morris water maze test of hippocampal-based memory function showed that the molecule prevented impairment of spatial reference memory associated with the high-fat diet. In ecotoxicity studies, adult fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were chronically exposed to the molecule for 4 weeks at 40 ug/L. The molecule treatment induced significant up-regulation of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) encoding the egg-protein vitellogenin in male fish, an indication of endocrine disruption."}
{"input": "What is the value of the Toxicity for the molecule O=C(O)CCCCC1CCSS1?", "output": "The molecule is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. A cholinesterase inhibitor suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death. Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. Acetylcholine esterase inhibition results in acetylcholine buildup and continuous nerve impulses transmission, preventing muscle contractions from stopping. Phosphorus-based compounds are common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, designed to bind to the enzyme's active site. The structural requirements include a phosphorus atom with two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen."}

It also acts as an inhibitor of farnesyl transferase. The molecule noncompetitively inhibits the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20S proteasome and displays anti-inflammatory activity. It acts by blocking thiol groups in the cell membranes. The molecule is also cytotoxic and causes neurite degeneration. Mycotoxins are often able to enter the liver and kidney by human organic anion transporters (hOATs) and human organic cation transporters (hOCTs). They can also inhibit uptake of anions and cations by these transporters, interfering with the secretion of endogenous metabolites, drugs, and xenobiotics including themselves. This results in increased cellular accumulation of toxic compounds causing nephro- and hepatotoxicity."}
{"input": "I'm interested in knowing the Toxicity of CC(C)Br. Could you provide that?", "output": "The molecule is an organobromide compound, especially alkylbromides, which are strong alkylating agents. Consequently they can randomly modify the surfaces of proteins and lipids, leading to the disruption of enzyme, transporter or membrane functions. One of the most probable protein targets is the TRPA1 ion channel that is expressed in sensory nerves (trigeminal nerve) of the eyes, nose, mouth and lungs. Alkylation of DNA by alkylbromides may also lead to mutations. 2-bromopropane triggers the mitochondrion-dependent apoptotic pathway via ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation. 2-bromopropane has also been shown to induce DNA damage, impair functional antioxidant cellular defenses, and enhance the lipid peroxidation in cultured Leydig cells."}
{"input": "Given the molecule named tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate, could you provide its Toxicity?", "output": "The molecule is a slightly yellow, oily liquid used as a fire-resistant and light stable plasticizer in the production of various materials. In human exposure and toxicity studies, it showed minimal skin irritation and no skin sensitization. In animal studies, acute systemic toxicity and irritation potential are low, with the liver being the target organ. Neurotoxicity studies in hens showed no effect on neuropathy target esterase, but inhibition of brain and plasma cholinesterases. In rats, degenerative changes were observed in nerve fibers, with females being more susceptible than males. TBEP also induced electrophysiologic changes in sciatic nerves. The long term toxicity and carcinogenicity have not been studied. In zebrafish, it inhibits nutrient degradation and induces apoptosis, but teratogenicity was not observed. The compound is absorbed dermally in animals, but information on kinetics and metabolism is lacking. A mutagenicity test in Salmonella typhimurium strains was negative. Ecotoxicity studies showed moderate toxicity to aquatic organisms."}

It was previously used as an extraction solvent for natural fats and oils, as well as for spices, hops, and decaffeination of coffee. However, these uses have been banned by the United States Food and Drug Administration. The molecule was also used as an anesthetic and analgesic in obstetrics. Symptoms of overexposure include headache, vertigo, visual disturbance, fatigue, giddiness, tremors, somnolence, nausea, vomiting, irritation of eyes and skin, dermatitis, cardiac arrhythmias, paresthesia, and liver injury. Death has occurred at very high concentrations and was associated with cardiac arrhythmia and massive liver damage. Workers exposed to lower levels reported symptoms such as sleepiness, dizziness, headache, and nausea. Animal studies have shown that exposure to the molecule can lead to increased relative liver weight and histopathological changes. In rats, exposure has been linked to an increase in leukemia incidence in males. Tumors have been found in the hematopoietic system, lungs, and mammary glands of mice, and in the pituitary and mammary glands of rats. The molecule has also been shown to have effects on genes and proteins related to metabolism, reproduction, and growth in certain organisms."}
{"input": "Given the molecule named InChI=1S/C8H4O3/c9-7-5-3-1-2-4-6(5)8(10)11-7/h1-4H, could you provide its Toxicity?", "output": "The molecule presents in many forms including a colorless liquid or needles, white needles, and white flakes. It has a mild, characteristic acrid odor. It is an important intermediate in the chemical industry. The major subsequent product groups are alkyd resins, plasticizers, hardener for resins, polyesters, pigments, chlorinated products, pharmaceutical intermediates, insecticides, diethyl phthalate, dimethyl phthalate, and laboratory reagent. It is also widely used in the production of as an anti-scorching agent, a rubber hardener, and as a light- and heat-stabilizer of polyolefins. Phthalic anhydride containing materials are used in coatings applications for home appliances, automobiles, medical devices and furniture. For humans, in the form of vapor, fume or dust is a primary irritant to mucous membranes and the upper respiratory tract. Workers exposed to mixtures of phthalic acid and developed conjunctivitis, bloody nasal discharge, atrophy of the nasal mucosa, hoarseness, cough, occasional bloody sputum, bronchitis, and emphysema. Several cases of bronchial asthma resulted; skin sensitization with occasional urticaria and eczematous response were also documented. Clinical sensitization of occurred in a worker who developed symptoms of rhinorrhea, lacrimation, and wheezing after chronic exposure. Positive skin tests, provocative bronchial challenges, and a high serum titer of specific IgE to corroborated his clinical hypersensitivity. Bronchial provocation studies showed immediate airway obstruction. Sensitized people can have serological reactivity of , both immunoglobulin E (IgE) and immunoglobulin G (IgG), but IgE appears to discriminate cases of asthma from workers without asthma better than IgG, because the prevalence of IgG is high in exposed workers. caused severe skin irritation in rabbits following 24 hr exposure. was also irritating to rabbit eyes in the Draize test. caused statistically significant increases in Th2 cytokines, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 in dermally sensitized and intratracheally challenged mice, compared with the control. Guinea pigs exposed to and challenged with 5.0 mg/cu m dust had significant numbers of hemorrhagic lung foci; and animals with the greatest number of foci had high IgG antibody activity to . Cats given 68 mg/kg body weight for 90 days developed meteorism (tympanites) and diarrhea, and some excitation of the NS without other signs of intoxication. Rabbits given 20 mg/kg body weight for 3 months developed leukocytosis and increased aldolase activity. On gross pathology examination there was moderate parenchymatous dystrophy of the liver cells with slight perivascular lymphoid infiltration. In some studies, exposure to high doses of can be fatal. Four mice exposed to sublimation of 10 mg/L, 4 hr/day for 14 days exhibited slightly reduced breathing. One mouse died after the second day while a second one was found dead after the last day on test. Oral doses in rats (starting at 20 mg/kg/day) were doubled weekly; 0.89 g/kg was reached by ninth wk. Rats that died at high dosage had severe nephrosis, with destruction of tubular epithelium. Surviving animals had gastric ulceration. did not show evidence of carcinogenicity in male and female mice fed 16,346 or 32,692 ppm (males) and 12,019 or 24,038 ppm (females) for 2 years. was significantly teratogenic to mice: Branched ribs, fused vertebrae and cleft palate were the most common defects. In regards to genotoxicity, was negative in Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 with or without rat and hamster liver S-9 metabolic activation. There was a genotoxic effect found with in vitro at extremely high, cytotoxic concentrations, and only in the absence of a metabolic activation system which is not expected to be relevant under in vivo conditions, where is rapidly hydrolyzed to the non-genotoxic phthalic acid. Chinese hamster ovary cells were exposed to higher doses (6, 8, 10 mM) for 3 hours in the presence or absence of S9; cells were then washed, further incubated and harvested at 20 hours from the beginning of the treatment. caused a decrease in pH when added to culture medium and was immediately neutralized with NaOH. Effects were observed in the main study only without S9 and only at the highest compound concentration which was very toxic (remaining cell counts 29 %) and gave precipitate. Chromosome aberration rate increased to 18.5 % at the highest dose compared with a control of 3%."}
{"input": "Given the molecule named 5-methyl-2-propan-2-ylphenol, could you provide its Toxicity?", "output": "The molecule forms colorless crystals, often large, or white crystalline powder. It is used as a pesticide (insecticide, fungicide, rodenticide, antimicrobial); also used in perfumery; as a mold and mildew preventive; in microscopy; as a preservative; antioxidant; flavoring; and lab reagent. The molecule is included in an FDA over-the-counter drug used as an antibacterial and antifungal agent, and approved as an excipient. In humans, the molecule on its own or as an ingredient in combination preparations, considering its wide use, has led to primary skin irritation and skin sensitisation only in rare cases. The molecule is a mild local irritant. It resembles phenol in its systemic actions but is less toxic, partly because it is less soluble. It produces gastric pain, nausea, vomiting, central hyperactivity (eg, talkativeness), occasionally convulsions, coma, cardiac and respiratory collapse. The molecule was not genotoxic in the human colon carcinoma cell line Caco-2. On acute oral administration, the molecule is harmful whereas it is practically non-toxic following acute dermal application. In the rabbit, the molecule is corrosive to the skin and eye. Rats subjected to subchronic administration in the feed for a period of 19 weeks tolerate the molecule at 10000 ppm. The molecule did not increase the incidence of spontaneous lung tumors in mice. In embryonic chickens, the molecule causes multiple malformations on injection into the air bubble or the yolk sac. In vivo, oral administration of the molecule does not induce micronuclei in mice even in the toxic dose range. In the Salmonella/microsome assay, the molecule exhibits no mutagenic effect; however, it has been reported to give positive results in the UDS test (liquid scintillation) and in the SCE test with embryonic cells of the Syrian hamster. The findings are statistically significant, though there is no strict dose-response relationship. The various other actions of the molecule include cytotoxic, antineoplastic, antibacterial, fungicidal, anti-inflammatory, spasmolytic and other pharmacodynamic effects. The effects of the molecule on olfactory memory and gene expression in the brain of the honeybee were explored in bees previously exposed to the molecule, and the specificity of the bee response to the conditioned stimulus was lost 24 hr after learning. The results also indicated that the genes coding for the cellular targets of the molecule could be rapidly regulated after exposure to this molecule. Essential oils (including the molecule) are used by beekeepers to control the Varroa mites infesting honeybee colonies."}
{"input": "What is the Toxicity associated with the molecule YBRVSVVVWCFQMG-UHFFFAOYSA-N?", "output": "The molecule enters the body and is transported in the blood or stored in tissues. The N-N-acetylation of the compound leads to the formation of toxic derivatives. The liver and thyroid are the targets of the molecule in animals."}
{"input": "I would like to know the Toxicity of the molecule referred to as RBACIKXCRWGCBB-UHFFFAOYSA-N.", "output": "The molecule 1-Butene oxide is a colorless liquid with a pungent, disagreeable, sweetish odor, somewhat like butyric acid. It is used as an intermediate for various polymers, a stabilizer for chlorinated solvents, and a corrosion inhibitor. Additionally, it is used as an acid scavenger for chlorine-containing materials such as trichloroethylene and to react with ammonia to produce alkanolamines. The molecule 1-Butene oxide is possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B). In animal studies, it was found to be irritating to the eyes and caused severe skin irritation (corrosion) if evaporation was minimized due to occlusive application, but had no effect with semi-occlusive application. It was not sensitizing in a guinea pig maximization test. In 90-day inhalation studies with rats and mice, 1-Butene oxide mainly caused nasal lesions. Systemic effects occurred at higher concentrations, such as decreased mean body weight gain in rats exposed to 2400 mg/cu m and renal tubular necrosis in mice exposed to the same concentration. There is clear evidence for 1-Butene oxide being a locally acting carcinogen in male rats, with inhalation of 600 mg/cu m causing no tumors and 1,200 mg/cu m causing neoplasms of the nasal cavity and lung in male rats. There is equivocal evidence for carcinogenic activity in female rats. No evidence for carcinogenic activity was found in male or female mice. 1-Butene oxide was genotoxic in vitro, but did not cause chromosomal aberrations in bone marrow or dominant-lethal mutations in germ cells of rats. In terms of reproductive toxicity, the 90-day studies with rats and mice did not reveal adverse effects on the reproductive organs up to 2400 mg/kg body weight. The lack of effect from pre-gestational exposure in the developmental toxicity study and a negative dominant-lethal test may indicate that 1,2-epoxybutane does not reach male and female germ cells in effective concentrations. No developmental toxicity or teratogenicity was detected in rats after inhalation of up to 3,000 mg/cu m throughout gestation."}
{"input": "Given the molecule named diethyl (4-nitrophenyl) phosphate, could you provide its Toxicity?", "output": "The molecule is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. A cholinesterase inhibitor suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death. Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. Acetylcholine esterase inhibition results in acetylcholine buildup and continuous nerve impulses transmission, leading to uninterrupted muscle contractions. Phosphorus-based compounds are common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, designed to bind to the enzyme's active site. The structural requirements include a phosphorus atom with two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen."}
{"input": "Would you be able to tell me the Toxicity of the molecule DTGKSKDOIYIVQL-NRPADANISA-N?", "output": "The molecule borneol is a solid used as a flavoring and medication, including traditional Chinese medicine. Borneol does not present a concern for skin sensitization and its toxicity is similar to that of camphor. In human peripheral blood lymphocytes exposed to varying concentrations of l-borneol, it was considered non-clastogenic. Laboratory animals are less susceptible to borneol toxicity compared to humans. Borneol increased the activity of CYP2D in rats and has been evaluated for antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities in mice. Borneol produced a significant reduction in nociceptive behavior and inhibited the writhing reflex in mice. In the hot plate test, borneol produced an inhibition of nociceptive behavior. Borneol-treated mice also had reduced carrageenan-induced leukocytes migration to the peritoneal cavity. The mutagenic potential of borneol was assessed in an Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium strains, and it was considered not mutagenic in bacteria."}
{"input": "Would you be able to tell me the Toxicity of the molecule C=CC1CN2CCC1CC2C(O)c1ccnc2ccc(OC)cc12.O=S(=O)(O)O?", "output": "The molecule is a class lA antiarrhythmic drug. The molecule is the d- isomer of quinine. The molecule is an alkaloid that may be derived from various species of Cinchona. Cinchona barks contain 0.25 to 3.0% of the molecule. The molecule is also prepared from quinine. The molecule is a powder or white crystals, odorless with a bitter taste. The molecule bisulfate is colorless crystals which is odorless and has a bitter taste. The molecule gluconate is a white powder which is odorless and has a bitter taste. The molecule poly-galacturonate is a powder. The molecule sulfate is a white powder or odorless crystals with a bitter taste. Indications: Description: Premature ventricular extrasystoles and ventricular tachycardia; supraventricular arrhythmia; maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion of atrial flutter or fibrillation. HUMAN EXPOSURE: Main risks and target organs: Cardio-toxicity is the main risk of the molecule poisoning. The molecule may induce central nervous system symptoms. Summary of clinical effects: Toxic effects appear within 2 - 4 hours after ingestion but the delay may vary according to the molecule salt and to the preparation forms. Symptoms may include disturbances of cardiac rhythm (especially in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease), neurotoxicity and respiratory depression. Diagnosis: Cardiac disturbances: circulatory arrest, shock, conduction disturbances, ventricular arrhythmias, ECG changes, Neurological symptoms: tinnitus, drowsiness, syncope, coma, convulsions, delirium. Respiratory depression. The molecule concentrations may be helpful in diagnosis but are not useful for clinical management. Contraindications: Allergy or idiosyncrasy to cinchona alkaloids; atrioventricular or complete heart block; intraventricular conduction defects; absence of atrial activity; digitalis intoxication; myasthenia gravis and ventricular dysrhythmia of the torsades de pointes type Precautions include the following: Congestive heart failure, hypotension, renal disease, hepatic failure; concurrent use of other antiarrhythmic drugs; old age and breast-feeding. Routes of entry: Oral: Oral absorption is the most frequent cause of intoxication. Parenteral: Intoxication after IV administration is rare but has been reported in patients treated with IV the molecule for cardiac dysrhythmia. Absorption by route of exposure: Oral: The molecule is almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. However, because of hepatic first-pass effect, the absolute bioavailability is about 70 to 80% of the ingested dose and may vary between patients and preparations. The time to plasma peak concentration is 1 to 3 hours for the molecule sulfate, 3 to 6 hours for the molecule gluconate and about 6 hours for the molecule polygalacturonate. Sustained-release the molecule is absorbed continuously over 8 to 12 hours. Parenteral: Absorption of the molecule after intramuscular injection may be erratic and unpredictable with incomplete absorption of the administered dose, probably due to precipitation of drug at the site of injection. Other studies indicate no difference between the rate of the molecule absorption when given by intramuscular injection or oral absorption. Distribution by route of exposure: Oral: Protein binding: About 70 to 80% of the drug is bound to plasma protein. Plasma protein binding is decreased in patients with chronic liver disease. Tissue: The molecule concentrations in liver are 10 to 30 times higher than those in plasma. Skeletal and cardiac muscle, brain and other tissues contain intermediate amounts. The red cell plasma partition ratio is 0.82. Biological half-life by route of exposure: Elimination half-life: The half-life is about 6 to 7 hours. It is increased in chronic liver disease and in the elderly. It does not appear to be altered in congestive heart failure or renal failure. Metabolism: 50 to 90% of the molecule is metabolized in the liver to hydroxylated products. Metabolites include 3-hydroxyquinidine, 2 oxoquinidinone, 0-desmethylquinidine, quinidine-N-oxide. The principal metabolite is 3 hydroxyquinidine which exerts similar effects to the molecule and may account for part of the observed antiarrhythmic effects. The elimination kinetics of hydroxyquinidine appear to be similar to those of the molecule. Elimination by route of exposure Kidney: The amount excreted unchanged in urine is variable but is about 17% of an administered dose. Up to 50% of a dose of the molecule (unchanged + metabolites) is excreted in urine within 24 hours after administration. Renal excretion is dependent upon the pH of the urine. Excretion varies inversely with urine pH. Excretion is reduced in renal insufficiency and in congestive heart failure. Liver: 50 to 90% of a dose of the molecule is metabolized in the liver. Bile: Approximately 1 to 3% is excreted in the feces via the bile. Breast milk: The molecule is excreted in breast milk. Mode of action Toxicodynamics: The molecule reduces the permeability of heart muscle to electrolytes (membrane stabilizer) and is a general cardiac depressant. It has a negative inotropic effect; inhibits the spontaneous diastolic depolarization; slow conduction; lengthens the effective refractory period; and raises the electrical threshold. This results in depression of contractility, impaired conductivity (atrioventricular and intraventricular) and decreased excitability but with possible abnormal stimulus re-entry mechanism. The molecule has an anticholinergic effect and peripheral vasodilator properties. In experimental studies the following progression changes was observed: ECG: bradycardia, prolongation of the PR interval, lengthening of the QT interval, widening of the QRS with development of an idioventricular rhythm and then in ventricular standstill. Sometimes the terminal event was ventricular fibrillation. Blood pressure decreases progressively. A significant decrease of blood pressure was noted with the appearance of QRS widening and blood pressure was close to zero when slow idioventricular rhythm appeared. Electrolytes abnormalities: decrease in plasma concentrations of potassium, sodium and magnesium with the development of acidosis. Electrolytes: Hypokalaemia may occur and is probably related to an intracellular transport of potassium by a direct effect on cellular membrane permeability. Neurologic symptoms: Syncope and convulsions may represent a direct toxic effect on CNS or may be related to cerebral ischaemia due to circulatory or respiratory failure. Pharmacodynamics: The molecule slows the rate of firing of the normal and of ectopic rhythmic foci; it raises the threshold for electrically induced arrhythmias; it protects against ventricular arrhythmias; and it prevents or terminates circus movement flutter. Teratogenicity: The molecule has been implicated as a cause of light cranial nerve damage to the fetus at doses much larger than those needed to treat arrhythmias. Interactions: Several interactions have been reported. The molecule has a synergistic action with warfarin (decrease of prothrombin level). The molecule potentiates both non-depolarizing and depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. The cardiodepressant effects of other antiarrhythmic agents are increased by concurrent use of the molecule; amiodarone increases the molecule concentrations in the blood. The molecule concentrations are reduced by: rifampicin, anticonvulsants, nifedipine and acetazolamide. The molecule concentrations are increased by antacids, cimetidine, verapamil and amiodarone; the risk of the molecule toxicity is increased by terfenadine, astemizole, and thiazide and loop diuretics. The molecule increases the plasma concentrations of propafenone and digoxin. Main adverse effects: Numerous adverse effects during the molecule therapy have been reported. Cardiovascular: Hypotension after IV administration; Syncope; proarrhythmic effect: \"torsades de pointes\"; and ECG: widening of QRS interval; prolongation of PR and QT intervals. CNS: Cinchonism: headache, fever, visual disturbances, mydriasis, tinnitus, nausea, vomiting and rashes. Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, colic have been reported. Hepatic: Granulomatous hepatitis or hepatitis with centrilobular necrosis. Skin: Skin rashes with drug fever and photosensitivity may result. Hematologic: Thrombocytopenia (immunologic reaction) has been noted. Clinical effects: Acute poisoning: Ingestion: Severity of the molecule poisoning is related to the cardiotoxic effects. Symptoms appear usually within 2 to 4 hours and may include: cardiovascular symptoms: hypotension, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest. ECG may show: decrease of T wave; prolongation of QT and QRS intervals; atrioventricular block; ventricular dysrhythmia (torsade de pointes). Neurological symptoms: tinnitus, drowsiness, syncope, coma, convulsion, blurred vision and diplopia. Respiratory symptoms: hypoventilation and apnea. Cardiotoxicity may be enhanced if other cardiotoxic drugs have been ingested (antiarrhythmic drugs, tricyclic antidepressants). Parenteral exposure: After IV administration symptoms appear more rapidly. Chronic poisoning: Ingestion: The most relevant symptoms of chronic poisoning are: ECG disturbances; syncope due to ventricular dysrhythmia, (torsade de pointes) and cinchonism gastrointestinal disturbances Course, prognosis, cause of death: The usual course of the molecule poisoning is dominated by the cardiovascular disturbances which usually occur within 2 to 4 first hours but may first appear as late as 12 hours after exposure (and perhaps even later after ingestion of a slow- release preparation). Symptoms may last for 24 to 36 hours. Patients who survive 48 hours after acute poisoning are likely to recover. Death may result from cardiac arrest by asystole or electromechanical dissociation and, rarely, by ventricular fibrillation. Systematic description of clinical effects: Cardiovascular: Acute: Cardiovascular symptoms are the major features of the molecule toxicity. Tachycardia due to anticholinergic effects is usually observed initially or in moderate intoxication. In severe intoxication, bradycardia due to atrioventricular block may occur. Hypotension and shock: hypotension due to peripheral vasodilation is common. In severe intoxication, cardiogenic shock with increased central venous pressure is usually observed and is related to decreased cardiac contractility. Cardiac arrest may occur, which may be related to electromechanical dissociation, ventricular dysrhythmia or asystole. Cardiac dysrhythmias are common and may include: atrioventricular block, idioventricular rhythm, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, torsades de pointes. ECG changes are always present in symptomatic intoxication: repolarization abnormalities, decreased T wave, increase of U wave, prolongation of QT and PR intervals, widening of QRS complexes (> 0.08 sec), atrioventricular block. Syncope due to torsade de pointes may occur. Chronic: ECG changes with repolarization abnormalities, decreased T wave and increase of QT interval are a common feature during the molecule therapy. Syncope is related to transient torsade de pointes and occurs in 1 to 8% of patients receiving the molecule. The occurrence of torsade de pointes is not correlated with plasma the molecule levels but is favored by an increase in the QT interval. Respiratory: Acute: Respiratory depression or apnea is mostly associated with severe cardiac disturbances such as shock or ventricular dysrhythmia. Pulmonary edema with normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure following an attempted suicide has been documented. Neurological: CNS: Acute: Drowsiness, delirium, coma and convulsions may appear without cardiac symptoms. However, cardiac failure should always be considered when CNS symptoms appear. Cinchonism may sometimes appear. Chronic: Cinchonism. Delirium has been reported. Peripheral nervous system: Chronic: The molecule can potentiate the neuromuscular blocking action of some skeletal muscle relaxants and may cause the return of respiratory paralysis if it is given shortly after recovery from neuromuscular blockade. Autonomic nervous system: Acute: The molecule has an anticholinergic effect. However, this effect is usually limited to the vagal system. Skeletal and smooth muscle: Chronic: An increase in serum concentrations of skeletal muscle enzymes has been reported in a man treated with the molecule. Gastrointestinal: Acute: Nausea and vomiting may occur. Chronic: Gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and colic) is the most frequent side effect of the molecule. Hepatic: Chronic: Hepatotoxicity has been reported, with an increase in serum concentrations of transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, and cholestasis. Renal: Acute: No direct nephrotoxic effect has been reported. Acute renal failure related to cardiogenic shock may occur. Dermatological: Chronic: Skin lesions have been attributed to the use of the molecule and include skin rash, photosensitivity and lichen planus. Eye, ear, nose, throat: local effects: Acute: Cinchonism is rarely observed in acute poisonings. Toxic amblyopia, scotoma and impaired color perception may occur at toxic doses. Chronic: Chronic cumulative overdose may cause cinchonism: headache, tinnitus, vertigo, mydriasis, blurred vision, diplopia, photophobia, deafness, and corneal deposits have been reported in a patient who took the molecule for two years. Hematological: Chronic: Thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia of immunologic origins have been reported. Immunological: Chronic: The molecule may cause several immunologic mediated reactions: thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, angioneurotic edema, skin rash, fever. Metabolic: Acid-base disturbances: Acute: Metabolic acidosis may occur in severe intoxication with shock. Fluid and electrolyte disturbances: Acute: Hypokalemia is frequently observed. Special risks: Pregnancy: Chronic: The molecule has been implicated as a cause of cranial nerve damage to the fetus at doses much larger than those needed to treat arrhythmias. In a neonate born to a woman taking the molecule throughout pregnancy, serum levels were equal to that of the mother. The child's ECG was normal and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. Breast-feeding: Chronic: The molecule is present in breast milk at levels slightly lower than serum levels. The dose of the molecule received by an infant taking 1l of milk would be below therapeutic doses. However, breast-feeding is not recommended because of potential the molecule accumulation in the immature newborn liver."}

DPNA is used in small quantities in laboratory research. It has no known commercial use. The molecule demonstrated DNA-damaging activity in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. In rats, the molecule caused liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) and benign and malignant tumors of the esophagus (papilloma and carcinoma) following administration in the drinking water or subcutaneous injection. Subcutaneous injection of the molecule also caused tumors of the lung and nasal and paranasal sinus cavities in hamsters and rats, tumors of the laryngobronchial tract in hamsters, and benign and malignant kidney tumors (adenoma and adenocarcinoma) in rats. Liver tumors were observed in monkeys exposed by intraperitoneal injection. Cancer (carcinoma) of the liver, esophagus, and nasal cavity was described in rats exposed by stomach tube, and tracheal tumors were described in male hamsters exposed by intratracheal instillation. In addition, administration of the molecule in the drinking water caused forestomach tumors in male rats. Testing of the molecule on Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and Escheria coli WP2 uvrA/pKM101 produced mutagenicity.

Could you provide that?", "output": "The molecule is a cellular toxicant that impairs transport systems, enzyme activities, and receptor functions. It primarily targets the central nervous system, particularly the globus pallidus of the basal ganglia. It is believed that the manganese ion, Mn(II), enhances the autoxidation or turnover of various intracellular catecholamines, leading to increased production of free radicals, reactive oxygen species, and other cytotoxic metabolites, along with a depletion of cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms, leading to oxidative damage and selective destruction of dopaminergic neurons. In addition to dopamine, the molecule is thought to perturb other neurotransmitters, such as GABA and glutamate. In order to produce oxidative damage, the molecule must first overwhelm the antioxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase. The neurotoxicity of Mn(II) has also been linked to its ability to substitute for Ca(II) under physiological conditions. It can enter mitochondria via the calcium uniporter and inhibit mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. It may also inhibit the efflux of Ca(II), which can result in a loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity. Mn(II) has been shown to inhibit mitochondrial aconitase activity to a significant level, altering amino acid metabolism and cellular iron homeostasis."}

{"input": "Please tell me the Toxicity of the compound named FDHRBCMXYSGNPA-UHFFFAOYSA-N.", "output": "The molecule is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. Carbamates form unstable complexes with cholinesterases by carbamoylation of the active sites of the enzymes. This inhibition is reversible. A cholinesterase inhibitor suppresses the action of acetylcholine esterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholine esterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses. Headache, salivation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea are often prominent at higher levels of exposure. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop."}
{"input": "I would like to know the Toxicity of the molecule referred to as O.[Cu].[Cu].", "output": "The molecule sequesters excess copper within hepatocyte lysosomes, where it is complexed with metallothionein. Copper hepatotoxicity is believed to occur when the lysosomes become saturated and copper accumulates in the nucleus, causing nuclear damage. This damage is possibly a result of oxidative damage, including lipid peroxidation. Copper inhibits the sulfhydryl group enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, and paraoxonases, which protect the cell from free oxygen radicals. It also influences gene expression and is a co-factor for oxidative enzymes such as cytochrome C oxidase and lysyl oxidase. In addition, the oxidative stress induced by copper is thought to activate acid sphingomyelinase, which lead to the production of ceramide, an apoptotic signal, as well as cause hemolytic anemia. Copper-induced emesis results from stimulation of the vagus nerve."}

Mercury binds to microsomal and mitochondrial enzymes, resulting in cell injury and death. It inhibits aquaporins, halting water flow across the cell membrane, and the protein LCK, causing decreased T-cell signalling and immune system depression. Mercury inhibits neuronal excitability by acting on the postsynaptic neuronal membrane and affects the nervous system by inhibiting protein kinase C and alkaline phosphatase, impairing brain microvascular formation and function, as well as altering the blood-brain barrier. It also produces an autoimmune response, likely by modification of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, self peptides, T-cell receptors, or cell-surface adhesion molecules."}

{"input": "I'm interested in knowing the Toxicity of [C-]#N.[C-]#N.[Cd+2]. Could you provide that?", "output": "The molecule initially binds to metallothionein and is transported to the kidney. Toxic effects are observed once the concentration of the molecule exceeds that of available metallothionein, and it has also been shown that the molecule-metallothionein complex may be damaging. Accumulation of the molecule in the kidney results in increased excretion of vital low and high weight molecular proteins. The molecule is a high affinity zinc analog and can interfere in its biological processes. It also binds to and activates the estrogen receptor, likely stimulating the growth of certain types of cancer cells and causing other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. The molecule causes cell apoptosis by activating mitogen-activated protein kinases. Organic nitriles decompose into cyanide ions both in vivo and in vitro. Consequently the primary mechanism of toxicity for organic nitriles is their production of toxic cyanide ions or hydrogen cyanide. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected.

{"input": "What is the Toxicity of the molecule called C[Sb](C)(C)(F)Cl?", "output": "The molecule inhalation data suggest that the myocardium is a target of antimony toxicity. It is possible that antimony affects circulating glucose by interfering with enzymes of the glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways. The mechanism of action of antimony remains unclear. However, some studies suggest that antimony combines with sulfhydryl groups including those in several enzymes important for tissue respiration. The antidotal action of BAL depends on its ability to prevent or break the union between antimony and vital enzymes. Moreover, the cause of death is believed to be essentially the same as that in acute arsenic poisoning."}

{"input": "Tell me the Toxicity of the molecule aluminum;trisodium;hexafluoride, please.", "output": "The molecule's main target organs are the central nervous system and bone. Aluminum binds with dietary phosphorus and impairs gastrointestinal absorption of phosphorus. The decreased phosphate body burden results in osteomalacia and rickets. Aluminum's neurotoxicity is believed to involve several mechanisms. Changes in cytoskeletal protein functions as a results of altered phosphorylation, proteolysis, transport, and synthesis are believed to be one cause. Aluminum may induce neurobehavioral effects by affecting permeability of the blood-brain barrier, cholinergic activity, signal transduction pathways, lipid peroxidation, and impair neuronal glutamate nitric oxide-cyclic GMP pathway, as well as interfere with metabolism of essential trace elements because of similar coordination chemistries and consequent competitive interactions. It has been suggested that aluminum's interaction with estrogen receptors increases the expression of estrogen-related genes and thereby contributes to the progression of breast cancer, but studies have not been able to establish a clear link between aluminum and increased risk of breast cancer. Certain aluminum salts induce immune responses by activating inflammasomes."}

The primary toxicity of Aconitum sp. alkaloids affects the heart and central nervous system. They can induce cardiac flutter or fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias, and repetitive after-potentials and oscillations following nerve stimulation. The electrophysiological mechanism of the arrhythmogenic effect of aconitine involves a delay in the final repolarization phase of the action potential, leading to premature or triggered excitations. These effects are caused by the removal of inactivation of voltage-dependent Na+ channels. The massive influx of Na+ results in excitation followed by complete inexcitability of nerve cells. Aconitum sp. alkaloids trigger dopamine release from dopaminergic neurons, leading to excessive extracellular dopamine that stresses cellular antioxidant systems and induces neuron apoptosis. They are known as cardiotoxins and neurotoxins, with embryotoxicity and cytotoxicity properties. (A15426)\n\nThe molecule Mesaconitine activates inhibitory noradrenergic neurones of descending inhibitory pathways. It can evoke a long-lasting excitatory action at low concentrations, a depressant action at high concentrations, and biphasic effects in an intermediate concentration range, possibly involving the noradrenergic system. The biphasic effect observed with 30 and 100 nM mesaconitine application is similar to the action of noradrenaline in the rat hippocampal CA1 region. The selective prevention of the two different actions evoked by 30 and 100 nM mesaconitine in a biphasic manner with pretreatment of a- and b-adrenoceptor antagonists provides evidence that the effects involve the activation of a- and b-receptors.

The most common adverse events in human studies were typical class effects of oral retinoids, such as headache, flushing, and skin disorders. Sensitization to alitretinoin was reported in the literature. In vitro tests showed that alitretinoin was not clastogenic in human lymphocytes. In animal studies, administration of alitretinoin to pregnant mice at 3 mg/kg on day 7.5 resulted in a 12% resorption rate and 0% exencephaly in 58 implants. Among the 51 live fetuses given alitretinoin, there were 9 cases of microphthalmia and 6 cases of anophthalmia. Alitretinoin was found to be less potent than trans retinoic acid for these endpoints. Rabbits given oral doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day during organogenesis showed an increased incidence of fused sternebrae and limb and craniofacial defects. Mice given a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg on day 11 of gestation also exhibited limb and craniofacial defects. Oral alitretinoin was embryocidal in rabbits at doses of 1.5 mg/kg/day and in rats at doses of 5 mg/kg/day, as indicated by early resorptions and post-implantation loss. In vitro tests, including the Chinese hamster ovary cell HGPRT mutation assay, showed that alitretinoin was not mutagenic. In vivo tests, such as the mouse micronucleus test, also showed that alitretinoin was not clastogenic. Ecotoxicity studies in the Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus revealed that all retinoic acid isomers, including alitretinoin, exerted toxic effects on the skeletal systems mainly through the RAR pathway at 6-9 days post-hatching."}

Body weight gain and food intake were reduced at the two highest doses. All high-dose rats died within 12 months and exhibited high incidences of malnutrition and atrophy/necrosis of lymphoid organs. In a 2-year study, dogs and mixed-breed dogs were given oral doses of 0, 1, 10 or 100 mg of the molecule base/kg bw per day by capsule. After this study had progressed for 153 days, it was expanded by adding further groups of male and female mongrel dogs given doses of 200 or 400 mg of the molecule base/kg bw per day for the remainder of the study period. Occasional diarrhea and vomiting occurred in dogs given 10-400 mg/kg bw per day. Transient elevated bromosulfophthalein retention times were recorded in two dogs at 100 mg/kg bw per day and one dog at 400 mg/kg bw per day. At necropsy, mild pyelonephritis was found in one dog given 200 mg/kg bw per day, and bilateral nephrosis, mild chronic pyelonephritis and mild chronic cystitis were seen in one dog given 400 mg/kg bw per day.

However, topical overdosing could result in an increased incidence of local skin reactions. In rats given repeat IV dosing for 28 days, treatment-related effects included transient tachypnea, which was not dose-related, lethargy and/or subdued behavior and decreased food consumption. In mice dosed for 7 consecutive days, one animal receiving 60 ug/kg/day and all animals receiving >/= 80 ug/kg/day were killed prematurely after </= 4 days of dosing because of the severity of physical signs, which were dose-related. In mini-pigs, no deaths occurred at 5 ug/kg/day ingenol mebutate for 4 consecutive days or 3 ug/kg/day for 28 days. Treatment-related effects were limited to sporadic and transient subdued behavior, emesis and slightly reduced body weight gain post-dose at 2.5 ug/kg/day. An increase in embryo-fetal mortality as well as increased incidence of fetal visceral and skeletal variations was noted in pregnant rabbits exposed to ingenol mebutate intravenously. No treatment related effects on embryofetal toxicity or teratogenicity were noted after intravenous administration to pregnant rats.

The molecule NTO was not a skin sensitizer in guinea pigs. The molecule NTO induced testicular toxicity and oligospermia in repeated-dose oral toxicity tests in rats. To evaluate whether NTO produces additional reproductive and developmental effects, a modified extended one-generation reproductive toxicity test was conducted in rats. The molecule NTO did not markedly affect measures of fertility, including mating indices, gestation index, litter size, and sex ratio. Seminiferous tubule degeneration or atrophy was observed in P1 and F1 3600-mg/L NTO males. F1 males in the 3600 mg/L group exhibited reduced reproductive organ mass (testes, epididymides, and accessory sex organs).

{"input": "For the molecule identified as CHIFCDOIPRCHCF-UHFFFAOYSA-N, what is its Treatment?", "output": "The molecule flumazenil (Anexate) is a competitive benzodiazepine receptor antagonist that can be used as an antidote for benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil is very effective at reversing the CNS depression associated with benzodiazepines but is less effective at reversing respiratory depression. Its use, however, is controversial as it has numerous contraindications. It is contraindicated in patients who are on long-term benzodiazepines, those who have ingested a substance that lowers the seizure threshold, or in patients who have tachycardia or a history of seizures. As a general rule, medical observation and supportive care are the mainstay of treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. Although benzodiazepines are absorbed by activated charcoal, gastric decontamination with activated charcoal is not beneficial in pure benzodiazepine overdose as the risk of adverse effects often outweigh any potential benefit from the procedure. It is recommended only if benzodiazepines have been taken in combination with other drugs that may benefit from decontamination. Gastric lavage (stomach pumping) or whole bowel irrigation are also not recommended. Hypotension may be combated by the use of norepinephrine or metaraminol. Dialysis is of limited value. General supportive measures should be employed, along with intravenous fluids, and an adequate airway maintained."}
